# Nested and chained conditionals
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-09-08_

## Announcements
* Homework 1 due tomorrow at 5pm

## Warm-up
\#1) _Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
day = input("Today is ")
if (day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday"):
    print("It is the weekend")
else:
    print("It is a weekday")
if (day == "Wednesday"):
    print("Halfway to the weekend")
print("Happy " + day + "!")
```

```

```

\#2) _What will the program output if a user enters `Saturday`?_

```



```

\#3) _What will the program output if a user enters `Monday`?_

```



```

\#4) _What will the program output if a user enters `Wednesday`?_

```



```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Nested conditionals

### Example


```python
x = int(input("x="))
y = int(input("y="))
if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        print("x is positive, y is positive")
    else:
        print("x is positive, y is negative")
else:
    print("x is not positive")
print(x, "+", y, "=", x+y)
```

### Practice
\#1) _Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
a = int(input("a="))
if a >= 50:
    print("Large")
else:
    if (a < 10):
        print ("Small")
    else:
        print("Medium")
```

```









```

\#2) _What will the program output if a user enters `5`?_

```
```

\#3) _What will the program output if a user enters `10`?_

```
```

\#4) _What will the program output if a user enters `55`?_

```
```

\#5) _Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
i = int(input("i="))
j = int(input("j="))
if i > 5:
    if j > 15:
        print("A")
else:
    if j > 15:
        print("B")
if i > 10:
    print("C")
```

```








```

\#6) _What will the program output if a user enters `5` and `20`?_

```
```

\#7) _What will the program output if a user enters `10` and `40`?_

```
```

\#8) _What will the program output if a user enters `20` and `5`?_

```
```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the above questions; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Chained conditionals

### Example


```python
day = int(input("Day? "))
if day <= 7:
    print("1st week")
elif day > 7 and day <= 14:
    print("2nd week")
else:
    print("Beyond")
print("End")
```

### Practice
_Re-write each program to use chained conditionals instead of nested conditionals_


```python
#1)
a = int(input("a="))
if a >= 50:
    print("Large")
else:
    if (a < 10):
        print ("Small")
    else:
        print("Medium")
```

```Python








```


```python
#2)
i = int(input("i="))
j = int(input("j="))
if i > 5:
    if j > 15:
        print("A")
else:
    if j > 15:
        print("B")
if i > 10:
    print("C")
```

```Python








```

## Extra practice

### Programming with conditionals
\#1) _Write a program that asks for a person's age and outputs whether they are a minor (under 18), an adult (18 or older), and/or a teenager (age 13 through 19)._

```Python







```

\#2) _Write a program that asks for the number of hours an employee works each week and outputs whether they work full-time (40 or more hours), half-time (exactly 20 hours) or part-time (less than 40 hours, but not exactly 20 hours)._

### Tracing conditionals
_For each of the following programs, which code blocks will be executed when the listed conditions are true?_

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
if condition 2:
    code block B
elif condition 3:
    code block C
else:
    code block D
```

\#1) _When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

\#2) _When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

\#3) _When only condition 1 is True_

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
    if condition 2:
        code block B
    elif condition 3:
        code block C
else:
    code block D
```

\#4) _When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

\#5) _When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

\#6) _When only condition 1 is True_

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
    if condition 2:
        code block B
    else:
        code block C
if condition 3:
    code block D
```

\#7) _When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

\#8) _When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

\#9) _When only condition 1 is True_
