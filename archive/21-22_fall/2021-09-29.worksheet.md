_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-09-29_

## Announcements
* Homework 3 due tomorrow at 5pm

## Warm-up
_What is the output of this program?_


```python
def func1(x, y):
    print(x, y)
    return x + y

def func2(x, y):
    z = x
    x = y
    y = z
    print(x, y)

x = "A"
y = "B"
result1 = func1(x, y)
print(result1)
result2 = func2(x, y)
print(x, y, result2)
```

```





```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up question; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Modular programming

_Convert each of the following programs into a modular version with at least one function_


```python
#1)
standard_wall_height = 10

# Calculate square feet of wall space in offices
office_short_wall = standard_wall_height * 8
office_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 12
per_office = 2 * office_short_wall + 2 * office_long_wall
total_office = 10 * per_office

# Calculate square feet of wall space in classrooms
classroom_short_wall = standard_wall_height * 25
classroom_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 40
per_classroom = 2 * classroom_short_wall + 2 * classroom_long_wall
total_classroom = 4 * per_classroom

# Calculate square feet of wall space in hallways
hallway_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 150
per_hallway = 2 * hallway_long_wall
total_hallway = 2 * per_hallway

# Calculate square feet of wall space in total
total = total_office + total_classroom + total_hallway
print(total)
```

```python
#2)
wins = 0

# First game
colgate_score = 0
boston_college_score = 51
if (colgate_score > boston_college_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("Boston College won")

# Second game
colgate_score = 3
stony_brook_score = 24
if (colgate_score > stony_brook_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("Stony Brook won")
    
# Third game
colgate_score = 7
wm_score = 27
if (colgate_score > wm_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("W&M won")
    
print("Colgate won", wins, "games")
```

## Extra practice

_What is the output of each of the following programs?_


```python
#1)
def func1(a, b, c):
    print(b)
    print(a)
    print(c + a)
    return a + b

def func2(a, b, c):
    print(b)
    return c + a

def func3(a, b, c):
    print("W"+b)
    return b + a

a = "X"
b = "Y"
c = "Z"
d = func1(b, c, a)
e = func2(d, a, b)
print(func3(a, e, func1(e, d, c)))
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>


```python
#2)
def alpha(x, y):
    return x + y

def beta(x):
    z = alpha(x, 3)
    return z**2

i = 4
print(beta(i))
```

```

```


```python
#3)
def contribute(item):
    """Ask for person's contributions to something"""
    amount = float(input("How much did you contribute to "+item+"? "))
    return amount
    
def compute_deductions():
    """Calculate total deduction"""
    charity = contribute("charity")
    ira = contribute("a traditional IRA")
    itemized = charity + ira
    if itemized < 12550:
        itemized = 12550
    return itemized

def taxable(income, deductions):
    taxable = income - deductions
    return taxable

def main():
    income = float(input("How much did you earn? "))
    deductions = compute_deductions()
    net = taxable(income, deductions)
    print("Your taxable income is $"+str(net))

main()
```

Use inputs: `54000`, `500`, `1000`
