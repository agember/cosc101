# sentinel values
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-10-08_

## Announcements
* Homework 5 due Thursday

## Warm-up
_Write a function called `lazy_divide` that takes a dividend and a divisor (both integers) and uses subtraction to compute the result of performing integer division._

```











```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Loop patterns

### Accumulator pattern


```python
import random
code = ""
while len(code) < 6:
    digit = random.randint(0,9)
    code = code + str(digit)
print("Your temporary security code is", code)
```

### Sentinel pattern


```python
sentinel = True
while sentinel:
    num = int(input("Enter a positive number (or -1 if finished):"))
    if num == -1:
        sentinel = False
    else:
       print("You entered", num)
print("Done")
```

### Polling pattern


```python
choice = ""
while choice != "A" and choice != "B" and choice != "C":
    choice = input("Do you want A, B, or C? ")
print("You chose " + choice)
```

### Selecting a pattern
_For each of the following scenarios, indicate which loop pattern you should apply. (You **do not** need to write any code.)_

\#1) _Write a function called `acronym` that takes a multi-word phrase and returns a string containing the first letter of each word in the phrase._

```

```

\#2) _Write a function called `ask_questions` that takes a yes/no question and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the user answered yes or no, respectively._

```

```

\#3) _Create a modified `main` function for homework 4 that **does not** ask for the number of customers ahead of time and **does not** print the total amount billed after all customers' information has been entered._

```

```

\#4) _Create a modified `one_customer` function for homework 4 that asks the user to enter a new billing code and/or meter reading if they enter an invalid billing code or meter reading._

```

```

\#5) _Write a function called `get_day_of_year` that prompts the user to enter a day of the year and returns a valid day of the year (1 through 365) as an integer._

```

```

\#6) _Write a function called `get_max_digit` that takes a string of digits and returns the largest digit. For example, `get_max_digit("3142")` should return `4`._

```

```

\#7) _Write a function called `total_caffeine` that asks the user to enter the milligrams (mg) of caffeine for each beverage they consumed in a day until the user indicates they are done consuming beverages. The function should return the total caffeine consumed._

```

```

## Extra practice
_Discount Airlines, Inc. has asked you to write a Python program to help its customers calculate how many reward miles they have earned. Your program should repeatedly ask the user for the distance of a flight until the user enters 0. Then your program will output the total number of miles flown and whether the customer achieved bronze (less than 20,000 miles flow) or silver (at least 20,000 miles flow) status._
