print(c, y)
```

    ['red', 'yellow', 'orange']
    ['yellow', 'blue', 'green'] ['yellow', 'blue', 'green']


## Practice writing code with strings
\#1) Write a function called `emphasize_vowels` that makes all vowels in a string uppercase. For example:
* `emphasize_vowels('Spring')` should return `SprIng`
* `emphasize_vowels('break')` should return `brEAk`


```python
def emphasize_vowels(phrase):
    """Make all vowels in phrase uppercase
    
    >>> emphasize_vowels('Spring')
    'SprIng'
    >>> emphasize_vowels('break')
    'brEAk'
    """
    new = ""
    for c in phrase:
        if c in "aeiou":
            new = new + c.upper()
        else:
            new = new + c
    return new
```

\#2) Write a function called `find_reverse` that takes a phrase and a word and returns True if the word appears backwards in the phrase. For example:
* `find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'bat')` should return `True`
* `find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'tab')` should return `False`
* `find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'saw') `should return `True`


```python
def find_reverse(phrase, word):
    """Determines if word appears backwards in phrase
    
    >>> find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'bat')
    True
    >>> find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'tab')
    False
    >>> find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'saw')
    True
    """
    reverse = ""
    for char in word:
        reverse = char + reverse
    return reverse in phrase
```

## Practice writing code with lists and files
Assume the file `dimensions.csv` contains the following data:
```
sport,type,width,length
football,field,160,360
basketball,court,50,94
soccer,field,210,330
hockey,rink,85,200
tennis,court,27,78
squash,court,21,32
baseball,field,325,325
rugby,field,226,360
curling,rink,15,148
```

\#1) *Write a program that prints out the names of the columns contained in `dimensions.csv`.*


```python
infile = open('dimensions.csv', 'r')
first = infile.readline()
columns = first.split(',')
for column in columns:
    print(column)
infile.close()
```

    sport
    type
    width
    length
    


\#2) *Write a function called `get_sports` that returns a list of the names of the sports contained in `dimensions.csv` **sorted** in alphabetical order.*


```python
def get_sports():
    '''
    >>> get_sports()
    ['baseball', 'basketball', 'curling', 'football', 'hockey', 'rugby', 'soccer', 'squash', 'tennis']
    '''
    infile = open('dimensions.csv', 'r')
    infile.readline()
    sports = []
    for line in infile:
        values = line.split(',')
        sports = sports + [values[0]]
    infile.close()
    sports.sort()
    return sports
```

\#3) *Write a program that prints out the sport name and playing surface dimensions for each sport in `dimensions.csv` whose playing surface is called a "court".*


```python
infile = open('dimensions.csv', 'r')
infile.readline()
for line in infile:
    values = line.strip().split(',')
    if (values[1] == "court"):
        print(values[0],values[2],'x',values[3])
infile.close()
```

    basketball 50 x 94
    tennis 27 x 78
    squash 21 x 32


\#4) *Write a function called `get_types` that returns a list of the playing surface types contained in `dimensions.csv`. Each surface type should only be inclued in the list once, even if appears in `dimensions.csv` multiple times.*


```python
def get_types():
    '''
    >>> get_types()
    ['field', 'court', 'rink']
    '''
    infile = open('dimensions.csv', 'r')
    infile.readline()
    types = []
    for line in infile:
        values = line.split(',')
        if values[1] not in types:
            types = types + [values[1]]
    infile.close()
    return types
```

\#5) *Write a program that creates a new comma-separated variable (CSV) file called `areas.csv` that contains the sport name and area of the playing surface for each sport in `dimensions.csv`.*


```python
infile = open('dimensions.csv', 'r')
outfile = open('areas.csv', 'w')
infile.readline()
for line in infile:
    values = line.strip().split(',')
    area = int(values[2]) * int(values[3])
    outfile.write(values[0]+","+str(area)+"\n")
infile.close()
outfile.close()
```

## More practice reading code


```python
#1)
a = "spring"
b = ""
c = ""
i = 0
while a[i] not in "aeiou":
    b = b + a[i]
    c = c + a[len(a) - 1 - i]
    i = i + 1
print(b, c)
```

## More practice writing code

\#1) Write a function called `appears_both` that takes a phrase and a word and returns True if any words in the phrase appear both forward and backwards. You must use the `find_reverse` function. For example:
* `appears_both('he was using the saw')` should return `True` because `saw` and `was` appear in the sentence
* `appears_both('the tab was upside down')` should return `False`


```python
def appears_both(phrase):
    """Checks if any words in phrase appear both forward and backward
    
    >>> appears_both('he was using the saw')
    True
    >>> appears_both('the tab was upside down')
    False
    """
    phrase = phrase + " "
    word = ""
    for char in phrase:
        if char == " ":
            if find_reverse(phrase, word):
                return True
            word = ""
        else:
            word = word + char
    return False
```

\#2) *Write a program that prints out the name of each of the sports contained in `dimensions.csv`.*


```python
infile = open('dimensions.csv', 'r')
infile.readline()
for line in infile:
    values = line.split(',')
    print(values[0])
infile.close()
```
