* Accessing files
* Reading files
* Reading data files

# Warm-up
Write a function called `split_name` that takes a single string containing a person's last name and first name, separated by a comma, and returns a list containing the person's first name and last name, in that order. For example `split_name('Gember-Jacobson, Aaron')` should return `['Aaron', 'Gember-Jacobson']`.


```python
def split_name(name):
    '''
    Converts a person's name written as 'Last, First' into a list of names ['First', 'Last']
    >>> split_name('Gember-Jacobson, Aaron')
    ['Aaron', 'Gember-Jacobson']
    '''
    parts = name.split(', ')
    names = [parts[1], parts[0]]
    return names
```

## Accessing files

* Files can contain many different types of data—text, image, video, audio, source code, etc.
    * Same type of data may also be stored in different formats—e.g., audio may be encoded as mp3, aac, etc.
* You have already used the `cImage` module to read/write images
* _What does a program need to do before it can read data from a file?_ — open the file for reading
    * `open` takes filepath and mode (`'r'` for read or `'w'` for write) as arguments; returns file object


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
```

* _What does a program need to do when it is done reading data from file?_ — close the file


```python
myfile.close()
```

## Reading files

### Overview
* Read every line of the file, one line at a time — use a for loop


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
for line in myfile:
    print(line)
myfile.close()
```

    First line
    
    Second line
    
    Third line


* Read one line at a time — use the `readline` function
    * The next call to `readline` returns the next line of the file
    * If the file is closed and then opened again, the next call to `readline` will start at the beginning of the file
     * When the end of the file is reached, `readline` returns the empty string (`""`)


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
line1 = myfile.readline()
line2 = myfile.readline()
myfile.close()
print(line1)
print(line2)

myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
line1again = myfile.readline()
myfile.close()
print(line1again)
```

    First line
    
    Second line
    
    First line
    


* Read all lines of the file into a list of strings — use the `readlines` function


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
list_of_lines = myfile.readlines()
myfile.close()
print(list_of_lines)
```

    ['First line\n', 'Second line\n', 'Third line']


* Read the entire file into a string — use the `read` function


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
entire_file = myfile.read()
myfile.close()
print(entire_file)
```

* Strings include the newline character (`'\n'`)
    * Remove newline using the `strip` function


```python
line1 = line1.strip()
line2 = line2.strip()
print(line1)
print(line2)
```

    First line
    Second line


### Practice

_Assume the file `flowers.txt` contains the following data:_
```
Rose
Tulip
Daisy
```

*What is the output of each of the following programs?*


```python
#1)
flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
data = flowers.readline()
print(len(data))
print("#"+str(data)+"#")
flowers.close()
```

    5
    #Rose
    #



```python
#2)
flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
for data in flowers:
    data = data.strip()
    print(len(data))
    print("#"+str(data)+"#")
flowers.close()
```

    4
    #Rose#
    5
    #Tulip#
    5
    #Daisy#



```python
#3)
flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
data = flowers.read()
data = data.strip()
print(len(data))
print("#"+str(data)+"#")
flowers.close()
```

    16
    #Rose
    Tulip
    Daisy#



```python
#4)
flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
data = flowers.readlines()
print(len(data))
print("#"+str(data)+"#")
flowers.close()
```

    3
    #['Rose\n', 'Tulip\n', 'Daisy\n']#


## Reading data files

### Overview
* A comma-separated variable (CSV) file is often used to store data
* Each line in a CSV file is like a row in a table (or spreadsheet)
* A comma (`,`) is used to delineate the values (or columns) within each line (or row)
* The first line of the file usually contains column names
* Assume the file `people.csv` contains the following data on notable computer scientists:
```
LastName,FirstName,KnownFor
Johnson,Katherine,was a "human computer" at NASA
Dean,Mark,co-created the IBM personal computer
Berners-Lee,Tim,invented the World Wide Web
Hopper,Grace,found the first computer bug
```

* Use `readline()` to read the first line containing the column names
* Use `strip()` to remove the "trailing newline"
* Use `split(',')` to convert a line into a list of values


```python
people = open('people.csv', 'r')
first = people.readline()
first = first.strip()
column_names = first.split(',')
print(column_names)
```

    ['LastName', 'FirstName', 'KnownFor']


* Use for loop to iterate through lines (or rows) of data
* Again, use `strip` and `split`
* Use indexing or slicing to access specific values


```python
for line in people:
    values = line.strip().split(',')
    print(values[1],values[0],values[2])
```

    Katherine Johnson was a "Human computer" at NASA
    Mark Dean co-created the IBM personal computer
    Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web
    Grace Hopper found the first computer bug


* Remember to close the file!


```python
people.close()
```

* Instead of using `readline` and a for loop, you can use `readlines` with indexing, slicing, and a for loop


```python
people = open('people.csv', 'r')
lines = people.readlines()
people.close()

first = lines[0].strip()
column_names = first.split(',')
print(column_names)
for line in lines[1:]:
    values = line.strip().split(',')
    print(values[1],values[0],values[2])
```

    ['LastName', 'FirstName', 'KnownFor']
    Katherine Johnson was a "Human computer" at NASA
    Mark Dean co-created the IBM personal computer
    Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web
    Grace Hopper found the first computer bug


## Extra Practice

\#1) *Write a function called `load_data` that takes a filename and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the data from one row of the file. The column names should **not** be included.*


```python
def load_data(filename):
    '''
    Return a list containing rows of data from a file
    >>> load_data('people.csv')
    [['Johnson', 'Katherine', 'was a "human computer" at NASA'], 
     ['Dean', 'Mark', 'co-created the IBM personal computer'], 
     ['Berners-Lee', 'Tim', 'invented the World Wide Web'], 
     ['Hopper', 'Grace', 'found the first computer bug']]
    '''
    datafile = open(filename, 'r')
    datafile.readline() # Discard column names
    rows = []
    for line in datafile:
        values = line.strip().split(',')
        rows.append(values)
    datafile.close()
    return rows
```

\#2) *Write a function called `ask_question` that takes the rows of data from a file of a people and asks a question using the value in the `KnownFor` column. For example, `Who co-created the IBM personal computer?`*


```python
import random

def trivia_question(data):
    '''Ask a trivia question about a randomly choosen person'''
    index = random.randrange(0, len(data))
    row = data[index]
    known_for = row[2]
    print("Who "+known_for+"?")
    guess = input("Enter a person's name: ")
    answer = row[1]+" "+row[0]
    if (answer == guess):
        print("You're correct! Well done!")
    else:
        print("Sorry, your answer is incorrect. The correct answer is: "+answer)
    
trivia_question(load_data('people.csv'))
```

    Who found the first computer bug?


    Enter a person's name:  Grace Hopper


    You're correct! Well done!
