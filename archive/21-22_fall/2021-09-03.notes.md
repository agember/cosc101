## Outline
* Warm-up
* Homework 1 overview
* Input
* "input-process-output" programs
* Reassignment

## Warm-up
\#1) _Write a program that calculates the area of a rubgy field, which is 100 meters long and 68 meters wide._


```python
length = 100
width = 68
area = length * width
print(area, "m²")
```

    6800 m²


\#2) _Write a program that calculates the area of a volleyball court, which is 16 meters long and 8 meters wide._


```python
length = 16
width = 8
area = length * width
print(area, "m²")
```

    128 m²


\#3) _Are there any patterns you observe?_

The code is the same except for the values assigned to the `length` and `width` variables

## Homework 1 overview

## Input

### Overview
* _Why do we want to get input from the user?_ — to make programs more: flexible, useful
* Use the `input` function to get user input
* _What does a programmer provide to the `input` function?_ — a prompt string (i.e., a message that is displayed before waiting for user input
    * E.g., `input("How old are you? ")`
* What is the result of this expression?


```python
type(input("How old are you? "))
```

    How old are you? 18





    str



* _Where is the value returned by `input` stored?_ — nowhere, unless you call input on the right-hand side of an assignment statement

### Example
Write a program that asks a user for their name and age, and outputs: `<name> you don’t look a day over <age - 1>`


```python
name = input("What is your name ? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age) - 1
print(name, "you don’t look a day over", age)
```

    What is your name ? Joe Biden
    How old are you? 78
    Joe Biden you don’t look a day over 77


* _Why do we need to call `int` on the age?_ — `input` returns a string
* _What happens if a user does not enter a number ofr their age?_ — runtime error

## "input-process-output" programs

### Overview
* A common pattern for programs is the following:
    * Ask for input
    * Perform some computation on the input
    * Display the result
* The above program is an example of this pattern

### Practice

_Evaluate the following programs. If input is needed, provide your own. Indicate what output is produced, if any. If an error occurs, specify what type of error._


```python
#1)
name = input("What is your name? ")
count = len(name)
print("There are " + str(count) + " letters in your name.")
```

    What is your name? Aaron
    There are 5 letters in your name.



```python
#2)
year = input("What year is it? ")
year = year + 1
print("Next year is", year)
```

    What year is it? 2021



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_12517/318286003.py in <module>
          1 year = input("What year is it? ")
    ----> 2 year = year + 1
          3 print("Next year is", year)


    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str



```python
#3)
human = input("How old are you? ")
dog = int(human) * 7
print("You are", dog, "years old in dog years")
```

    How old are you? 18
    You are 126 years old in dog years


\#4) _Write a program that asks for the length and width of an athletic field and prints the area._


```python
length = int(input("How long is the field? "))
width = int(input("How wide is the field? "))
area = length * width
print("The field is", area, "m²")
```

    How long is the field? 100
    How wide is the field? 68
    The field is 6800 m²


\#5) _Write a program that asks for the cost of an item and prints the tax amount and total cost with a tax rate of 8%._


```python
cost = float(input("How much does the item cost? "))
tax = cost * 0.08
print("Tax", tax)
total = cost + tax
print("Total", total)
```

    How much does the item cost? 9.99
    Tax 0.7992
    Total 10.789200000000001


## Reassignment

### Overview
* When a variable name is used on the left-hand side of an assignment statement...
    * The first time: the variable is created and refers to the value on the right-hand side
    * Subsequent times: the variable is updated to refer to the value on the right-hand side
* When you use a variable in an expression or statement (excluding the left-hand side of an assignment statement), the latest value assigned to the variable is used

### Example


```python
myVar = 5
print(myVar)
myVar = 10
print(myVar)
```

    5
    10


* Drawing a reference diagram can help you understand what your program is doing
    * Reference diagram after executing myVar = 5
        ```
                ┏━━━━┓
        myVar━━>┃  5 ┃
                ┗━━━━┛
        ```
    * Reference diagram after executing myVar = 10
        ```
                ┏━━━━┓
        myVar━━>┃ 10 ┃
                ┗━━━━┛
        ```

### Practice

_For each program: (1) indicate what it will output, and (2) draw a reference diagram depicting the state of each variable after the program has executed._


```python
#1)
fruit = "apple"
vegetable = "beet"
fruit = "cranberry"
print(fruit, vegetable)
```

    cranberry beet



```python
#2)
x = 'ab'
y = 123
x = x + 'c'
print(x, y)
```

    abc 123



```python
#3)
r = 1
s = 2
r = r + s
s = r
print(r, s)
```

    3 3



```python
#4)
first = "Computer"
second = "Science"
third = first + second
first = 101
third = third + str(first)
print(first)
print(second)
print(third)
```

    101
    Science
    ComputerScience101


## Programming practice

\#1) _Write a program that plays a short game of mad libs: ask for three words and fill them in a sentence. (E.g., They **verb** the **adjective** **noun**.)_


```python
verb = input("Verb? ")
adjective = input("Adjective? ")
noun = input("Noun? ")
print("They", verb, "the", adjective, noun)
```

    Verb? ate
    Adjective? red
    Noun? apple
    They ate the red apple


\#2) _Write a program that asks for a temperature in fahrenheit and outputs the temperature in degrees celsius. (To convert: subtract 32 and multiply by five-ninths)_


```python
farenheit = input("Temperature in °F? ")
celcius = (int(farenheit) - 32) * 5 / 9
print(str(celcius) + "°C")
```

    Temperature in °F? 70
    21.11111111111111°C


\#3) _Write a program that asks for three integers and prints the average._


```python
one = input("First number? ")
two = input("Second number? ")
three = input("Third number? ")
sum = int(one) + int(two) + int(three)
average = sum / 3
print(average)
```

    First number? 5
    Second number? 25
    Third number? 30
    20.0


\#4) _Re-write the above program to use a single variable whose value is reassigned._


```python
total = int(input("First number? "))
total = total + int(input("Second number? "))
total = total + int(input("Third number? "))
total = total / 3
print(total)
```

    First number? 5
    Second number? 25
    Third number? 30
    20.0


\#5) _Write a program that converts a time in seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, 4567 seconds is: `1:16:7` (1 hour, 16 minutes, and 7 seconds)._


```python
seconds = int(input("How many seconds? "))
hours = int(seconds / (60 * 60))
minutes = int(seconds % (60 * 60) / 60)
seconds = seconds % 60
print(str(hours)+":"+str(minutes)+":"+str(seconds))
```

    How many seconds? 4567
    1:16:7
