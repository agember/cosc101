## Warm-up
_Write a program that trains a decision tree using a training set of data and uses it to predict labels for a testing set of data. Assume the program already includes the following functions:_
* `get_training_features` — _returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the feature values (i.e., column values) for a single item (i.e., row) in the training dataset_
* `get_training_labels`— _returns a list of strings that contains the labels for each item (i.e., all rows) in the training dataset_
* `get_testing_features`  — _returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the feature values (i.e., column values) for a single item (i.e., row) in the testing dataset_
