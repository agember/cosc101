## Announcements
* Final exam Tuesday 12pm-2pm
* Office hours
    * Today 10:15am-11:45am
    * Monday 12pm-4pm

    * Earn 2 points of extra credit on final exam for each talk you attend (earnings capped at 4 points)

## Final exam topics
* The final exam is *cumulative* and encompasses all topics covered by earlier exams.
* The *new* concepts since the last exam include:
    * dictionaries
    * use of data structures (list, dictionaries) in different types of problems
    * machine learning

## Dictionaries and lists
*What is the output of the following programs?*


```python
#1)
def lookup(lst, dct):
    r = ''
    for i in lst:
        r += dct[i] + '.'
    return r[:-1]

c = 'May'
d = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 8: c[-1], 4: c[1]}
print(lookup([2, 4], d))
print(lookup([1, 8], d))
print(lookup([1, 2, 3, 4], d))
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>


```python
#2)
def insert(lst1, lst2, dct):
    for i in range(len(lst1)):
        if lst1[i] not in dct:
            dct[lst1[i]] = [lst2[i]]
        else:
            dct[lst1[i]] += [lst2[i]]
    return dct

d = {}
d2 = insert(['a', 'b'], [1, 2], d)
print(d)
print(d2)
d3 = insert(['b', 'c', 'b'], [3, 4, 5, 6], d2)
print(d3)
d4 = insert(['d', 'e'], [7], d3)
print(d4)
```

```



```


```python
#3)
def remove(lst, dct):
    i = 0
    while i < len(lst):
        if lst[i] in dct:
            dct[lst[i]].remove(i)
            del lst[i]
        i += 1

lst1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
dct1 = {'a': [0, 1, 2], 'b': [0, 1, 2], 'c': [0, 1, 2]}
remove(lst1, dct1)
print(lst1)
print(dct1)
```

```



```


```python
#4)
def flip(dct1):
    dct2 = {}
    for i in dct1:
        dct2[dct1[i]] = i
    return dct2

dctA = {'a': 'b', 'c': 'd', 'e': 'b'}
dctB = flip(dctA)
print(dctA)
print(dctB)
dctC = flip(dctB)
print(dctC)
```

## Strings
*Assume the following code has been executed:*

_What is the output of each of the following epxressions?_


```python
mystr[-1]
```

```

```


```python
mystr[len(mystr)]
```

```

```


```python
mystr[:2] + mystr[-2:]
```

```

```


```python
mystr * 2
```

```

```


```python
"_".join(mystr.split())
```

```

```

## Aliasing
*Which of the following are **pure** functions (i.e., they do not modify the original string or list passed to the function)?*


```python
def funcA(instr):
    outstr = instr[:]
    outstr = outstr.lower()
    return outstr
```


```python
def funcB(insrt):
    outstr = instr
    oustr = outstr.upper()
    return outstr
```


```python
def funcC(inlist):
    outlist = inlist
    outlist.append('New')
    return outlist
```


```python
def funcD(inlist):
    outlist = inlist
    outlist = outlist + ['New']
    return outlist    
```


```python
def funcE(inlist):
    outlist = inlist[:]
    outlist.extend(['New'])
    return outlist
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## Writing functions
\#1) *Write a function called `contains` that takes a string (`to_search`) and a list of strings (`to_find`) as parameters and returns the first string in `to_find` that also appears in `to_search`. If no strings in `to_find` appear in `to_search`, then return `None`. For example:*
```
>>> contains('penguin', ['hen', 'pen', 'egg', 'in'])
'pen'
>>> contains('giraffe', ['hen', 'pen', 'egg', 'in'])
None
```

```











```

\#2) *Write a function called `get_choice `that takes a list of options (e.g., yes, no, maybe) and asks the user to choose one of the options by entering the first letter of the options. You may assume every option starts with a different letter. Your function should accept lower and uppercase letters. The function should return the chosen option (the full word, not just the first letter). If the user enters an invalid option, then the function should again ask the user to choose an option. For example:*
```
>>> get_choice(['yes','no','maybe'])
Yes, No, Maybe? X
Yes, No, Maybe? y
yes
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

\#3) *Write a function called `splice` that takes two strings (`str1` and `str2`) and an integer (`index`) as a parameter and returns a new string with `str2` inserted into `str1` at index. For example, `splice("abcd", "ef", 2)` should return `"abefcd"`. If `index` is less than zero, `str2` should be put at the front of `str1`; if index is greater than the length of `str1`, then `str2` should be put at the end of `str1`.*
