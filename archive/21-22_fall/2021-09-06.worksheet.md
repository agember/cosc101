# Hello, Python: boolean expressions; conditionals
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-09-06_

## Announcements
* Homework 1 due Thursday at 5pm
    * Office hours today 2:30-4pm
    * Open lab hours Sunday-Thursday 7-10pm

## Warm-up
_For each program: (1) indicate what it will output, and (2) draw a reference diagram depicting the state of each variable after the program has executed._


```python
#1)
a = 1
b = 2
a = a + b
print(a, b, a)
```

```


```


```python
#2)
a = 1
a = a + 2
b = a + 3
b = b + 4
print(a, b)
```

```


```


```python
#3)
a = 1
b = a + 3
a = b + 2
b = a + 4
print(a, b)
```

```


```


```python
#4)
quarter = "beet "
half = "mel-on"
measure = quarter * 2 + half
print(measure)
measure = "wa-ter-" + half
print(measure)
```

```


```

## Boolean expressions

_Which of the following are valid boolean expressions?_

\#1) `True`

\#2) `"True"`

\#3) `1 < 2`

\#4) `3 = 3`

\#5) `4 >= 4`

ðŸ›‘ Stop here after completing the above questions; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the extra practice.

## Order of operations

_Assume the following assignment statements have been executed:_


```python
x = -2
y = 0
z = 5
```

_What does each of the following boolean expressions evaluate to? If the expression is an invalid boolean expression, describe why._


```python
#1)
x < 0 and y < 0
```


```python
#2) 
z > 3 and z < 7
```


```python
#3)
y not == 0
```


```python
#4)
x < y or (z >= 0 and y <= 5)
```


```python
#5)
x + y < z
```


```python
#6)
"a" < "b"
```


```python
#7)
"b" < "C"
```

ðŸ›‘ Stop here after completing the above questions; if you have extra time please **skip ahead** to the programming practice.

## Conditional statements

### Example
```Python
print("This is always first")
if (x > 0):
	print("Expression is true")
	print("Hooray!")
else:
	print("Expression is false")
	print("Uh-oh!")
print("This is always last")
```


### Example without else clause
```Python
print("This is always first")
if (x > 0):
	print("Expression is true")
	print("This occurs sometimes")
print("This is always last")
```

### Practice
_For the following programs: (1) draw a flowchart and (2) specify what output will be produced._


```python
#1)
hour = 12
if (hour == 12):
    print("noon")
if (hour > 12):
    print("AM")
else:
    print("PM")
```

```














```


```python
#2)
cost = 200
refund = 3
if (cost > 100):
    refund = 10
refund = refund * 2
print(refund)
```

```














```
<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## Extra practice

### Boolean operations
_What is the output of each of the following programs?_


```python
#1)
print("True or True is", True or True)
print("True or False is", True or False)
print("False or True is", False or True)
print("False or False is", False or False)
```

```




```


```python
#2)
print("True and True is", True and True)
print("True and False is", True and False)
print("False and True is", False and True)
print("False and False is", False and False)
```

```




```

### Conditional statements

\#3) Write a program that asks the user a yes/no question and outputs `Correct` or `Incorrect` based on whether the user's answer. For example:
```
Is a whale a mammal? yes
Correct
```

```Python






```

\#4) Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and outputs whether or not the first number is evenly divisible by the second number. For example:
```
First number: 10
Second number: 5
10 is evenly divisible by 5
```

```Python






```
