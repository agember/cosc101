## Defining functions

### Overview
* _Recall: what is a function?_ â€” a set of statements that are referred to by a given name
* Thus far we have only used functions provided by Python (modules) â€” e.g., `str`, `type`, `print`, `input`, `random.randint`
* _Why would we want to write our own functions?_
    * Organize program into chunks that mirror how we decompose the problem/solution
        * Recall: decomposition (breaking a problem into sub-problems) is the first step of computational thinking
        * Recall: a good programming practice is to decompose the solution and implement one step at a time
    * Avoid duplicating code at multiple points in a program
        * A `for` loop only avoids duplicating code at a single point in a program
* _How would we write a function that takes a time in minutes and time in seconds and prints whether the time in minutes is greater than, less than, or equal to the time in seconds?_


```python
def compare_time(minutes, seconds):
    # minutes = 2
    # seconds = sec
    if (minutes * 60 < seconds):
        comparison = "is less than"
    elif (minutes * 60 > seconds):
        comparison = "is greater than"
    else:
        comparison = "equals"
    print(minutes, "minutes", comparison, seconds, "seconds")
```

* Parameters â€” values a function needs to do its job
* Statements in the function body are **not** executed until the function is called

### Practice

_Which of the following are valid function definitions? If a definition is invalid, describe what is wrong._


```python
#1)
def greet(name):
    print("Hello " + name)
```

Valid â€” function definition starts with `def` keyword; function name conforms to the rules of a variable name; parameters are enclosed in parenthesis; function body is indented


```python
#2)
def welcome:
    print("Welcome to Colgate")
```


      File "/var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_19499/728649032.py", line 2
        def welcome:
                   ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax



Invalid â€” missing parenthesis after function name


```python
#3)
def year()
    print("It is 2021")
```


      File "/var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_19499/2203606384.py", line 2
        def year()
                  ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax



Invalid â€” missing colon after parenthesis


```python
#4)
def mid-autumn-festival():
    print("September 21 was the Mid-Autumn Festival ")
```


      File "/var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_19499/1903050535.py", line 2
        def mid-autumn-festival():
               ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax



Invalid â€”Â cannot include `-` in function name


```python
#5)
def sports(a, b):
    print("Do you like to play " + a + " or " + b + "?")
```

Valid â€” paremters separated by commas


```python
#6)
watch(c):
    print("Did you watch " + c + " yesterday?")
```


      File "/var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_19499/4055639592.py", line 2
        watch(c):
                 ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax



Invalid â€” missing `def` keyword

## Calling functions

### Overview
* Function must be called in order for the statements it its body to be executed
    * Function must be defined before it can be called
* Arguments â€” values provided to a function
    * Must match the number and order of parameters
    * Functions implicitly start with statements that assign each argument to each parameter


```python
sec = 120
compare_time(2, sec)
```

    2 minutes equals 120 seconds


### Practice

_Assume a program defines the following functions:_


```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello " + name)

def welcome():
    print("Welcome to Hamilton")

def sports(a, b):
    print("Do you like to play " + a + " or " + b + "?")
```

_Which of the following are valid function calls? If a call is invalid, describe what is wrong._


```python
#1)
greet("Aaron")
```

    Hello Aaron


Valid â€” function exists; arguments enclosed in parenthesis; number of arguments matches number of parameters


```python
#2)
welcome
```




    <function __main__.welcome()>



Invalid â€” missing parenthesis


```python
#3)
sports("basketball", "lacrosse")
```

    Do you like to play basketball or lacrosse?


Valid


```python
#4)
greet()
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_19499/3902655829.py in <module>
          1 #4)
    ----> 2 greet()
    

    TypeError: greet() missing 1 required positional argument: 'name'


Invalid â€” number of arguments does not match number of parameters


```python
#5)
welcome()
```

    Welcome to Hamilton


Valid


```python
#6)
tvshow("Tiny House Nation")
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_19499/3471159768.py in <module>
          1 #6)
    ----> 2 tvshow("Tiny House Nation")
    

    NameError: name 'tvshow' is not defined


Invalid â€” function `tvshow` has not been defined

## Executing functions

### Overview
* When a function is called:
    * The statements in the body of the function definition are executed in order
    * After executing the last statement in the body, resume execution where the function was called

### Example


```python
def demoFn():
    print("demoFn 1")
    print("demoFn 2")

print("before demoFn")
demoFn()
print("after demoFn")
```

    before demoFn
    demoFn 1
    demoFn 2
    after demoFn


![Flowchart for example](figures/functions/example_executing.png)

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

### Practice
_For each of the following programs, indicate: (1) what the program outputs; (2) the order in which the statements will execute, starting with the `print("BEGIN")` statement_


```python
#1)
def halve(a):        # Line 1
    print(a / 2)     # Line 2
    
def double(b):       # Line 3
    print(b * 2)     # Line 4

print("BEGIN")       # Line 5
x = 8                # Line 6
print("Double")      # Line 7
double(x)            # Line 8
print("Half")        # Line 9
halve(x)             # Line 10
print("END")         # Line 11
```

    BEGIN
    Double
    16
    Half
    4.0
    END


5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 9, 10, 1, 2, 11


```python
#2)
def sum(a, b):       # Line 1
    print(a + b)     # Line 2

print("BEGIN")       # Line 3
sum(3, 4)            # Line 4
x = 5                # Line 5
y = 6                # Line 6
sum(x, y)            # Line 7
print("END")         # Line 8
```

    BEGIN
    7
    11
    END


3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 8


```python
#3)
def add(a, b):       # Line 1     
    print(a + b)     # Line 2
    
def sub(c, d):       # Line 3
    print(c - d)     # Line 4

print("BEGIN")       # Line 5
add(2, 3)            # Line 6
x = 8                # Line 7
y = 2                # Line 8
sub(x, y)            # Line 9
add(x + y, 1 + 2)    # Line 10
print("END")         # Line 11
```

    BEGIN
    5
    6
    13
    END


5, 6, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 3, 4, 10, 1, 2, 11


```python
#4)
def increment(x):    # Line 1 
    x = x + 1        # Line 2 

print("BEGIN")       # Line 3
a = 2                # Line 4 
increment(a)         # Line 5
print(a)             # Line 6
print("END")         # Line 7
```

    BEGIN
    2
    END


3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7

```
