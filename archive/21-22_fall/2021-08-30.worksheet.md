# Hello, Python: computational thinking; errors & debugging
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-08-30_

## Announcements
* Masks are required in class
* Before next class: read sections 2.1-2.7, 9.3 and answer pre-class questions

## Warm-up
What is an example of an algorithm you lookup and execute in real life?
(Recall: an algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that solve a problem.)

## Computational thinking practice
(1) _Draw a simple picture (e.g., a stick figure)._

<p style="page-break-after: always;"></p>

(2) _Write a set of steps someone should take (i.e., an algorithm) to draw the same picture._

<p style="height:35em;"></p>

(3) _Swap instructions with your neighbor and follow their instructions._

<p style="page-break-after: always;"></p>

(4) _Compare your drawings. How well does what you drew match up with what your neighbor originally drew? How can you improve your instructions?_

## Errors

_What type of error exists in each of the following programs?_ 


```python
print("six plus seven is...")
6-7
```

```python
print("Lucky number 13"
```

<p style="height:3em;"></p>


```python
13 / 0
```

<p style="height:3em;"></p>


```python
PRINT("13 men who offered $13 and 13 prayers")
```
