## Defining functions

_Which of the following are valid function definitions? If a definition is invalid, describe what is wrong._


```python
#1)
def greet(name):
    print("Hello " + name)
```

```

```


```python
#2)
def welcome:
    print("Welcome to Colgate")
```

```

```


```python
#3)
def year()
    print("It is 2021")
```

```

```


```python
#4)
def mid-autumn-festival():
    print("September 21 was the Mid-Autumn Festival ")
```

```

```


```python
#5)
def sports(a, b):
    print("Do you like to play " + a + " or " + b + "?")
```

```

```


```python
#6)
watch(c):
    print("Did you watch " + c + " yesterday?")
```

```

```

## Calling functions

_Assume a program defines the following functions:_


```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello " + name)

def welcome():
    print("Welcome to Hamilton")

def sports(a, b):
    print("Do you like to play " + a + " or " + b + "?")
```

_Which of the following are valid function calls? If a call is invalid, describe what is wrong._


```python
#1)
greet("Aaron")
```

```
```


```python
#2)
welcome
```

```
```


```python
#3)
sports("basketball", "lacrosse")
```

```
```


```python
#4)
greet()
```

```
```


```python
#5)
welcome()
```

```
```


```python
#6)
tvshow("Tiny House Nation")
```

```
```

## Executing functions

### Example


```python
def demoFn():
    print("demoFn 1")
    print("demoFn 2")

print("before demoFn")
demoFn()
print("after demoFn")
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

### Practice
_For each of the following programs, indicate: (1) what the program outputs; (2) the order in which the statements will execute, starting with the `print("BEGIN")` statement_


```python
#1)
def halve(a):        # Line 1
    print(a / 2)     # Line 2
    
def double(b):       # Line 3
    print(b * 2)     # Line 4

print("BEGIN")       # Line 5
x = 8                # Line 6
print("Double")      # Line 7
double(x)            # Line 8
print("Half")        # Line 9
halve(x)             # Line 10
print("END")         # Line 11
```

```




```


```python
#2)
def sum(a, b):       # Line 1
    print(a + b)     # Line 2

print("BEGIN")       # Line 3
sum(3, 4)            # Line 4
x = 5                # Line 5
y = 6                # Line 6
sum(x, y)            # Line 7
print("END")         # Line 8
```

```



```


```python
#3)
def add(a, b):       # Line 1     
    print(a + b)     # Line 2
    
def sub(c, d):       # Line 3
    print(c - d)     # Line 4

print("BEGIN")       # Line 5
add(2, 3)            # Line 6
x = 8                # Line 7
y = 2                # Line 8
sub(x, y)            # Line 9
add(x + y, 1 + 2)    # Line 10
print("END")         # Line 11
```

```


```


```python
#4)
def increment(x):    # Line 1 
    x = x + 1        # Line 2 

print("BEGIN")       # Line 3
a = 2                # Line 4 
increment(a)         # Line 5
print(a)             # Line 6
print("END")         # Line 7
```

3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7

```

```
