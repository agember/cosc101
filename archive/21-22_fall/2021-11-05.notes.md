# Warm-up
Write a function called `filter_above` that takes a list of integers and a single integer representing a threshold and returns a new list that contains all of the integers in the original list that are above the threshold.


```python
def filter_above(nums, threshold):
    '''Return all values in nums that are above threshold'''
    filtered = []
    for num in nums:
        if num > threshold:
            filtered.append(num)
    return filtered

def test_filter_above():
    orig = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    filtered = filter_above(orig, 3)
    if orig != [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] or filtered != [4, 5]:
        print("Failed 1st test: orig", orig, "filtered", filtered)
    else:
        print("Passed 1st test")
    
    orig = [8, 2, 3, 7, 8]
    filtered = filter_above(orig, 5)
    if orig != [8, 2, 3, 7, 8] or filtered != [8, 7, 8]:
        print("Failed 2nd test: orig", orig, "filtered", filtered)
    else:
        print("Passed 2nd test")
        
test_filter_above()
```

    Passed 1st test
    Passed 2nd test


## References and aliasing practice (continued)


```python
#4)
def swapTwo(p, q):
    r = p[:]
    s = q[:]
    r[1] = s[1]
    s[1] = p[1]
    
y = [1, 3, 5]
z = [2, 4, 6]
swapTwo(y, z)
print("Y", y, "Z", z)
```

    Y [1, 3, 5] Z [2, 4, 6]



```python
#5)
j = [5, 10]
k = j
j = j + [15]
print("J", j, "K", k)
```

    J [5, 10, 15] K [5, 10]



```python
#6)
m = [5, 10]
n = m
m = m.append(15)
print("M", m, "N", n)
```

    M None N [5, 10, 15]


## Strings and lists


* Use the `split` method to break a string into parts


```python
# Example with split
paragraph = "Can you jump like a kangaroo? Can you roar like a lion? Can you run like a cheetah?"
words = paragraph.split()
print(words)
sentences = paragraph.split('?')
print(sentences)
```

    ['Can', 'you', 'jump', 'like', 'a', 'kangaroo?', 'Can', 'you', 'roar', 'like', 'a', 'lion?', 'Can', 'you', 'run', 'like', 'a', 'cheetah?']
    ['Can you jump like a kangaroo', ' Can you roar like a lion', ' Can you run like a cheetah', '']


* Use the `join` method to combine a list of strings into a single string separated


```python
# Example with join
new_paragraph = '???'.join(sentences)
print(new_paragraph)
some_words = words[:2] + words[8:10] + words[-2:]
print(some_words)
new_sentence = ' '.join(some_words)
print(new_sentence)
```

    Can you jump like a kangaroo??? Can you roar like a lion??? Can you run like a cheetah???
    ['Can', 'you', 'roar', 'like', 'a', 'cheetah?']
    Can you roar like a cheetah?


* Use the `list` function to covert a string into a list of characters


```python
# Example with conversion to list
phrase = "Have a good day!"
characters = list(phrase)
print(characters)
```

    ['H', 'a', 'v', 'e', ' ', 'a', ' ', 'g', 'o', 'o', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'a', 'y', '!']


### Practice
*What is the output of each of the following programs?*


```python
#1)
year = 'five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes'
hundred = year.split(' hundred ')
print(hundred)
parts = year.split(' ')
new_year = parts[5:7] + parts[3:5] + parts[0:2] + parts[-1:]
print('-'.join(new_year))
```

    ['five', 'twenty five thousand six', 'minutes']
    six-hundred-five-thousand-five-hundred-minutes



```python
#2)
units1 = ["daylights", "sunsets", "midnights", "cups of coffee"]
how1 = ""
for unit in units1:
    how1 = how1 + "In " + unit + "? "
print(how1)
units2 = ["inches", "miles", "laughter", "strife"]
how2 = "In " + ", in ".join(units2) + "?"
print(how2)
```

    In daylights? In sunsets? In midnights? In cups of coffee? 
    In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife?


## Programming practice
\#1) *Write a function called `get_words` that takes a sentence and returns a list of the words (in all lowercase) in the sentence. If a word appears more than once, only include it in the list the first time it appears.*


```python
def get_words(sentence):
    '''
    Get a list of words in the sentence
    
    >>> get_words("thirteen has the most")
    ['thirteen', 'has', 'the', 'most']
    >>> get_words("Seven AND eight are tied")
    ['seven', 'and', 'eight', 'are', 'tied']
    >>> get_words("repeat this repeat this")
    ['repeat', 'this']
    '''
    # Get all words in the sentence in lowercase
    sentence = sentence.lower()
    all_words = sentence.split(' ')
    
    # Eliminate duplicates
    unique_words = []
    for word in all_words:
        if word not in unique_words:
            unique_words.append(word)
    return unique_words
```

\#2) *Write a function called `get_lengths` that takes a list of words and returns a list with the length of each word in the list.*


```python
def get_lengths(words):
    '''
    Compute the length of each word in the list of words
    
    >>> get_lengths(['thirteen', 'has', 'the', 'most'])
    [8, 3, 3, 4]
    >>> get_lengths(['seven', 'and', 'eight', 'are', 'tied'])
    [5, 3, 5, 3, 4]
    >>> get_lengths(['repeat', 'this'])
    [6, 4]
    '''
    lengths = []
    for word in words:
        length = len(word)
        lengths.append(length)
    return lengths
```

## Extra practice
\#1): *What is the output of the following programs?*


```python
prefixes = ["How about", "Measure in", "Seasons of"]
for i in range(1, 7, 2):
    prefixes[i:i] = ["love"]
print(prefixes)
lines = []
lines.append(prefixes[:2])
lines = lines + prefixes[2:4]
lines = lines + [prefixes[4:]]
print(lines)
lines[0:1] = lines[0] * 3
lines[-1] = lines[-1] * 2
print(lines)
```

    ['How about', 'love', 'Measure in', 'love', 'Seasons of', 'love']
    [['How about', 'love'], 'Measure in', 'love', ['Seasons of', 'love']]
    ['How about', 'love', 'How about', 'love', 'How about', 'love', 'Measure in', 'love', ['Seasons of', 'love', 'Seasons of', 'love']]


\#2) *Write a function called `get_longest` that takes a sentence and returns the longest word in a sentence. If there is a tie, then return a list of words that are tied for longest.*


```python
def get_longest(sentence):
    '''
    Get the longest word(s) in sentence
    
    >>> get_longest("thirteen has the most")
    'thirteen'
    >>> get_longest("Seven AND eight are tied")
    ['seven', 'eight']
    >>> get_longest("repeat this repeat this")
    'repeat'
    '''
    # Get the words and lengths
    words = get_words(sentence)
    lengths = get_lengths(words)
    
    # Determine the length of the longest word(s)
    longest_length = max(lengths)
    
    # Get the longest words
    longest_words = []
    for i in range(len(words)):
        if lengths[i] == longest_length:
            longest_words.append(words[i])
    
    # Return a single word or a list of words
    if len(longest_words) == 1:
        return longest_words[0]
    else:
        return longest_words
```
