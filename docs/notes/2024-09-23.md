# Iteration: range; accumulator pattern
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-09-23_

## Announcements
* Homework 3 due Friday at 6pm
* Homework 1 feedback available on Gradescope
    * Parts on which you received _Significant gaps_ or _Insufficient attempt_ are eligible for revision
    * Revisions to up to two parts from homeworks 1 and/or 2 are due Thurs, Oct 3 at 11:59pm

## Range

* `range(NUM)` â€” generates a sequence of `NUM` integers from `0` to `NUM-1`
    * E.g., `range(3)` â†  `[0, 1, 2]`
* Refactored grocery list program:


```python
def main() -> None:
    print("Grocery list:")
    groceries = ["grapes", "crackers", "cheese", "olives"]
    for num in range(len(groceries)):
        item = groceries[num]
        print(str(num + 1) + ". " + item)

main()
```

    Grocery list:
    1. grapes
    2. crackers
    3. cheese
    4. olives


* `range(START, STOP)` â€” generates a sequence of `STOP-START` integers from `START` to `STOP-1`
    * E.g., `range(2,5)` â†  `[2, 3, 4]`
* `range(START, STOP, INCREMENT)` â€” generates a sequence of integers from `START` to `(STOP-1)*INCREMENT`, with `INCREMENT` added to each successive integer
    * E.g., `range(2,8,2)` â†  `[2, 4, 6]`
* Sequence of integers is generated on-demand â€” use `list(range(...))` to get the full sequence

_What sequence of integers is produced by each of the following code snippets?_


```python
for w in range(6):
    print(w)
```

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5


```

```


```python
for x in range(10, 15):
    print(x)
```

    10
    11
    12
    13
    14


```

```


```python
for y in range(0, 7, 3):
    print(y)
```

    0
    3
    6


```

```


```python
for z in range(20, 15, -1):
    print(z)
```

    20
    19
    18
    17
    16


```

```

_What call to range would produce each of the following sequences of integers?_

`101, 102, 103, 104`


```python
for i in range(101, 105):
    print(i)
```

    101
    102
    103
    104


```

```

`10, 20, 30, 40, 50`


```python
for j in range(10, 51, 10):
    print(j)
```

    10
    20
    30
    40
    50


```

## Accumulator pattern

* Process of iteratively updating a variable
* To use the accumulator pattern, you must know:
    * What do you want to compute?
    * What is its type?
    * How can you build it one piece at a time?
* Applying the pattern
    ```Python
    accumVar = 0 # initialize accumulator variable; use the correct type
    for i in range(10): # iterate desired number of times
        accumVar = accumVar + 1 # update accumulator variable
    print(accumVar) # value of accumVar after the loop is the final result
    ```


```python
sum = 0
for i in range(4):
    sum = sum + int(input("Enter a number: "))
avg = sum / 4
print(avg)
```

    Enter a number:  2
    Enter a number:  4
    Enter a number:  6
    Enter a number:  8


    5.0


```










```

* Use a trace table to help understand the code

| Iteration # | Variable: sum | Variable: i | Output |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 1st         | 0 + 2 = 2     | 0           |        |
| 2nd         | 2 + 4 = 6     | 1           |        |
| 3rd         | 6 + 6 = 12    | 2           |        |
| 4th         | 12 + 8 = 20   | 3           |        |

_For each of the following programs: (1) draw a trace table; (2) provide the output._


```python
f = 1
for i in range(1, 4):
    f = f * i
print(f)
```

```


```python
word = "cloud"
spell = ""
for c in word:
    spell += c + "-"
print(spell)
```

    c-l-o-u-d-


```






```


```python
greeting = "Hello "
for part in ['first','last']:
    name = input("What is your " + part + " name? ")
    greeting = greeting + name + " "
print(greeting)
```

    What is your first name?  Clarence
    What is your last name?  Ellis


    Hello Clarence Ellis 


(Clarence "Skip" Ellis was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D. in computer science, a pioneer in Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Groupware, and the first African-American to be elected as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).)

## Extra practice

_For each of the following programs: (1) draw a trace table; (2) provide the output._


```python
def main() -> None:
    for char in "PEACE":
        print(char)

main()
```

    P
    E
    A
    C
    E


```







```


```python
def main() -> None:
    verbs = ["shoot", "cut", "kill"]
    nouns = ["words", "eyes", "hatefulness"]
    for i in [0,1,2]:
        print("You may " + verbs[i] + " me with your " + nouns[i] + ",")
    print("But still, like air, I'll rise.")
    print("~ Maya Angelou")

main()
```

    You may shoot me with your words,
    You may cut me with your eyes,
    You may kill me with your hatefulness,
    But still, like air, I'll rise.
    ~ Maya Angelou
