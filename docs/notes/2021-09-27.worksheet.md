_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-09-27_

## Announcements
* Homework 3 due Thursday

## Warm-up
_Label each of the following in the program below:_
1. Function body
2. Function call
3. Function definition
4. Argument (or actual parameter)
5. Parameter (or formal parameter)


```python
def update(x):
    if (x < 0):
        x = x + 1
    elif (x > 0):
        x = x - 1

a = 5
update(a)
print(a)
```

ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up question; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Scope

### Example


```python
def demoFn():
    varLocal = 3 # Defines local variable called varLocal
    print(varLocal) # Can access local variable varLocal within function
    print(varGlobal1) # Can access global variable varGlobal within function
    varGlobal2 = 4 # Defines new local variable called varGlobal2
    print(varGlobal2) # Can access local variable varGlobal2 within function

varGlobal1 = 1 # Define global variable called varGlobal1
varGlobal2 = 2 # Define global variable called varGlobal2
demoFn()
print(varGlobal2) # Will still have value 10
print(varLocal) # Cannot access local variable varLocal outside of function
```

### Practice
_What is the output of each of the following programs? If the program contains an error, describe the error._


```python
#1)
def multiply():
    print(x * y)

x = 4
y = 2
multiply()
```

```


```


```python
#2)
def divide(a, b):
    c = a // b

divide(10,5)
print(c)
```

```


```


```python
#3)
def sub():
    a = 5
    b = 3
    print(a - b)

a = 10
b = 4
sub()
print(a,b)
```

```


```


```python
#4)
def add(a, b):
    print(a + b)

a = 1
b = 2
add(5,6)
```

```


```


```python
#5)
def double(r):
    r = r * 2

double(10)
print(r)
```

```


```


```python
#6)
def decrement(y):
    y = y - 1
    return y

y = 10
z = decrement(y)
print(y,z)
```

```


```

## Return values

_What is the output of each of the following programs?_


```python
#1)
def magic(a):
    return a * 2

x = 5
print("x was " + str(x))
x = magic(x)
print("now it is " + str(x))
```

```


```


```python
#2)
def compute_exam_average(exam1, exam2, exam3):
    total = exam1 + exam2 + exam3
    average = total / 3
    return average

def convert_to_letter(grade):
    if grade >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif grade >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif grade >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif grade >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

percent = compute_exam_average(75, 85, 80)
letter = convert_to_letter(percent)
print("Exam grade:", letter, str(percent) + "%")
```

```

## Modular programming

_Convert each of the following programs into a modular version with at least one function_


```python
#1)
standard_wall_height = 10

# Calculate square feet of wall space in offices
office_short_wall = standard_wall_height * 8
office_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 12
per_office = 2 * office_short_wall + 2 * office_long_wall
total_office = 10 * per_office

# Calculate square feet of wall space in classrooms
classroom_short_wall = standard_wall_height * 25
classroom_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 40
per_classroom = 2 * classroom_short_wall + 2 * classroom_long_wall
total_classroom = 4 * per_classroom

# Calculate square feet of wall space in hallways
hallway_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 150
per_hallway = 2 * hallway_long_wall
total_hallway = 2 * per_hallway

# Calculate square feet of wall space in total
total = total_office + total_classroom + total_hallway
print(total)
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>


```python
#2)
wins = 0

# First game
colgate_score = 0
boston_college_score = 51
if (colgate_score > boston_college_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("Boston College won")

# Second game
colgate_score = 3
stony_brook_score = 24
if (colgate_score > stony_brook_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("Stony Brook won")
    
# Third game
colgate_score = 7
wm_score = 27
if (colgate_score > wm_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("W&M won")
    
print("Colgate won", wins, "games")
```

## Extra practice

\#1) _Write a program that asks the user for three words and prints the word with the most vowels. Your program must include at least one function._

```


















```

\#2) _Write a program that asks the user how many slices are desired for each of three different kinds of pizza and computes the number of pizzas of each kind to purchase. Assume one pizza has 8 slices. Your program must include at least one function._
