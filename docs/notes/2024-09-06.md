## Variables

* Recall the "dense" code we wrote last time to output the percentage savins for an item that normally costs 39.99, but is on sale for 22.99


```python
print(str(int((39.99 - 22.99) / 39.99 * 100)) + "% savings")
```

    42% savings


* Here is different code that produces the same output but uses _variables_


```python
original_price = 39.99
sale_price = 22.99
percent_savings = (original_price - sale_price) / original_price * 100
print(str(int(percent_savings)) + "% savings")
```

    42% savings


* A variable is a vessel for a value
* When you assign a value to a variable, you put the value in the vessel
    * E.g., `box = 2`
* When you use a variable in an expresison, you use the value in the vessel
    * E.g., `3 + box` evaluates to `5`
* When you assign a different value to a variable, you **replace** the value in the vessel
    * E.g., `box = 7`
* When you use a variable in an expression, you use the **current** value in the vessel
    * E.g., `3 + box` now evaluates to `10`
* Draw a reference diagram to help you understand what your program is doing
    * Reference diagram after executing box = 2
        ```
                ┏━━━━┓
        box ━━> ┃  5 ┃
                ┗━━━━┛
        ```
    * Reference diagram after executing box = 7
        ```
                ┏━━━━┓
        box ━━> ┃  7 ┃
                ┗━━━━┛
        ```

_For each of the following programs: (1) draw a reference diagram depecting the state of each variable as the program is executed; (2) indicate what the program will output._


```python
apples = 10
print(apples - 3)
print(apples)
```

    7
    10


```
          ┏━━━━┓
apples ━━>┃ 10 ┃
          ┗━━━━┛
```

## Input

* _Are there any patterns you observe in the programs that calculate the area of a rugy field and the area of a volleyball court?_ – the code is the same except for the values assigned to the `length` and `width` variables
* Instead of hard-coding values, use the `input` function to get user input – makes program more flexible and useful
* _What does a programmer provide to the `input` function?_ — a prompt string (i.e., a message that is displayed before waiting for user input
    * E.g., `input("How old are you? ")`
* What is the result of this expression?


```python
type(input("What is the length (in meters)? "))
```

    What is the length (in meters)?  100





    str



* _Where is the value returned by `input` stored?_ — nowhere, unless you call input on the right-hand side of an assignment statement
* Let's write a program that asks a user for the length and width of the field/court and calculates its area


```python
length = int(input("How long is the field/court (in meters)? "))
width = int(input("How wide is the field/court (in meters)? "))
area = length * width
print("The field/court is", area, "m²")
```

    How long is the field/court (in meters)?  100
    How wide is the field/court (in meters)?  68


    The field/court is 6800 m²


* _Why do we need to call `int` on the input?_ — `input` returns a string
* _What happens if a user does not enter a number for the length or width?_ — program terminates with an error
* This program demonstrates a common programming pattern ("input-process-output" programs):
    * Ask for input
    * Perform some computation on the input
    * Display the result

_Evaluate the following programs. If input is needed, provide your own. Indicate what output is produced or if an error occurs._


```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
count = len(name)
print("There are " + str(count) + " letters in your name.")
```

    What is your name?  Aaron


    There are 5 letters in your name.


<div style="height:5em;"></div>


```python
year = input("What year is it? ")
year = year + 1
print("Next year is", year)
```

    What year is it?  2024



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

          1 year = input("What year is it? ")
    ----> 2 year = year + 1
          3 print("Next year is", year)


    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str


<div style="height:5em;"></div>


```python
human = int(input("How old are you? "))
dog = human * 7
print("You are", dog, "years old in dog years")

```python
name = input("What is your name ? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
age = age - 1
print(name, "you don’t look a day over", age)
```

    What is your name ?  Joe Biden
    How old are you?  81


    Joe Biden you don’t look a day over 80


<div style="height:10em;"></div>

_Write a program that asks for the cost of an item and prints the tax amount and total cost with a tax rate of 8%._


```python
cost = float(input("How much does the item cost? "))
tax = cost * 0.08
print("Tax: $" + str(tax))
total = cost + tax
print("Total: $" + str(total))
```

    How much does the item cost?  11.00


    Tax: $0.88
    Total: $11.88


<div style="height:10em;"></div>

_Write a program that asks for a temperature in fahrenheit and outputs the temperature in degrees celsius. (To convert: subtract 32 and multiply by five-ninths)_


```python
farenheit = int(input("Temperature in °F? "))
celcius = (farenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
print(str(celcius) + "°C")
```

    Temperature in °F?  70


    21.11111111111111°C


<div style="height:10em;"></div>

_Write a program that asks for three integers and prints the average._


```python
one = int(input("First number? "))
two = int(input("Second number? "))
three = int(input("Third number? "))
sum = one + two + three
average = sum / 3
print(average)
```

    First number?  5
    Second number?  25
    Third number?  30


    20.0


<div style="height:10em;"></div>

_Re-write the above program to use a single variable whose value is reassigned._


```python
total = int(input("First number? "))
total = total + int(input("Second number? "))
total = total + int(input("Third number? "))
total = total / 3
print(total)
```

    First number? 5
    Second number? 25
    Third number? 30
    20.0
