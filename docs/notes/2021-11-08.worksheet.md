* Exam 3 next week Wednesday
    * Study materials posted on Moodle

# Warm-up
Write a function called `split_name` that takes a single string containing a person's last name and first name, separated by a comma, and returns a list containing the person's first name and last name, in that order. For example `split_name('Gember-Jacobson, Aaron')` should return `['Aaron', 'Gember-Jacobson']`.


```python







    
    
    
    
    
    
```

ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems.

## Reading files

_Assume the file `flowers.txt` contains the following data:_
```
Rose
Tulip
Daisy
```

*What is the output of each of the following programs?*


```python
#1)
flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
data = flowers.readline()
print(len(data))
print("#"+str(data)+"#")
flowers.close()
```

```







```


```python
#2)
flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
for data in flowers:
    data = data.strip()
    print(len(data))
    print("#"+str(data)+"#")
flowers.close()
```

```







```


```python
#3)
flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
data = flowers.read()
data = data.strip()
print(len(data))
print("#"+str(data)+"#")
flowers.close()
```

```







```


```python
#4)
flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
data = flowers.readlines()
print(len(data))
print("#"+str(data)+"#")
flowers.close()
```

```







```

## Extra Practice

\#1) *Write a function called `load_data` that takes a filename and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the data from one row of the file. The column names should **not** be included.*


```python
def load_data(filename):
    '''
    Return a list containing rows of data from a file
    >>> load_data('people.csv')
    [['Johnson', 'Katherine', 'was a "human computer" at NASA'], 
     ['Dean', 'Mark', 'co-created the IBM personal computer'], 
     ['Berners-Lee', 'Tim', 'invented the World Wide Web'], 
     ['Hopper', 'Grace', 'found the first computer bug']]
    '''

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
```

\#2) *Write a function called `ask_question` that takes the rows of data from a file of a people and asks a question using the value in the `KnownFor` column. For example, `Who co-created the IBM personal computer?`*
