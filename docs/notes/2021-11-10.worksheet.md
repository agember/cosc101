## Announcements
* Homework 8 due tomorrow at 5pm
* Exam 3 next week Wednesday
    * Study materials posted on Moodle

## Warm-up
Write a function called `odd_lines` that takes the name of a file and returns a list containing the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. line of the file.


```python
















```

ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, take a few deep breaths to help reduce stress.

## Debugging file reading/writing
Assume the file `months.txt` contains the following data:
```
January
February
March
April
May
June
July
August
September
October
November
December
```

*Identify and correct the error(s) in each of the following programs.*


```python
#1) Print the contents of the file
months = open('months.txt', 'r')
for line in months:
    print(line)
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>


```python
#2) Print the number of characters in each month
months = open('months.txt', 'r')
while months.readline() != '':
    line = months.readline()
    print(len(line))
months.close()
```

```




```


```python
#3) Store the number of lines in `months.txt` in a new file called `count.txt`
months = open('months.txt', 'w')
data = months.read()
months.close()
size = open('size.txt', 'w')
size.write('lines: '+str(len(data)))
size.close()
```

```




```

## Exceptions

\#1) *What happens if we run the following program and the user enters `one`?*


```python
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
```
