# Machine learning: introduction
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-12-04_

## Announcements
* Homework #8 due tomorrow @ 11:59pm
* Revisions to homeworks 5, 6, and/or 7 due Thurs, Dec 12 @ 11:59pm
* Exam 3 reattempts in class Wed, Dec 11

## Warm-up

_Consider the task of summing the numbers from 1 up to some maximum integer._
1. _What is the condition and result for the base case?_
2. _What is the smaller problem on which you recurse?_
3. _How do you combine the simple piece and the result of the recursive call?_

1. Condition: maximum is one; result: one
2. Maximum minus 1
3. Add the maximum to the sum of the numbers from 1 to the maximum-1

_What does the following program output?_


```python
def mystery(values: list) -> int:
    if len(values) == 1:
        return values[0]
    else:
        rest = mystery(values[1:])
        if (values[0] > rest):
            return values[0]
        else:
            return rest

def main() -> None:
    result = mystery([12, 4, 24, 13])
    print(result)

main()
```

    24

_What does the following program output?_


```python
def magic(num: int) -> int:
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        result = magic(num - 1)
        return result * 2

def main() -> None:
    result = magic(5)
    print(result)

main()
```

## What is machine learning (ML)?

* _What is machine learning?_ — deriving an algorithm from data, instead of being explicitly programmed
* Example: recognizing hand-written digits
    * Assume an image contains a hand-written digit
    * Recall: _How are images represented?_ — as a grid of pixels
    * If a pixel is black, it is part of the digit; if a pixel is white it is not part of the digit
    * _Given an image, how would you write an algorithm to determine if the image contains the digit 1?_ — look for a vertical sequence of black pixels; all other pixels should be white
        * _What if someone writes a 1 at a slight angle?_ — the digit won't be detected
        * _Could we fix this?_ — write a more complex algorithm that doesn't require the line to be strictly vertical
    * _Given an image, how would you write an algorithm to determine if the image contains the digit 7?_ — look for a horizontal sequence of black pixels whose right side intersects the top of a diagonal sequence of black pixels; all other pixels should be white
    * _Given an image, how would you write an algorithm to determine if the image contains the digit 5?_ — this is a hard problem for a human
* Machine learning approach: the computer "writes" the algorithm based on examples of hand-written digits
    * Algorithm learns probabilities that certain pixels are black or white for certain digits
    * For example, the corners of a hand-written 1 will always be white, whereas the upper-right corner of a hand-written 5 will be black with highly probability
    * Given a new image, the highest probability digit is identified
* Homework 8 is also using ML

## Key terms

* Model — the "algorithm" that is derived from data
    * For example, the probabilities of each pixel being black for each hand-written digit
* Training — the act of constructing a model
* Training data — information used to construct the model
* Features — characteristics of each data item
* Testing — the act of measuring a model's accuracy
* Testing data — information used to evaluate the model's accuracy; typically the data is split into training and testing

## Decision trees
* Similar to nested if-statements
* At each node in a decision tree, a decision is made (based on features of the data) and the appropriate branch is taken
* When there are no more branches, a final outcome (e.g., a label) is decided

## Activity
* Pictures of things
* Manually construct a decision tree to decide _does it fly?_
* Start with a single pile of pictures
* Select one meaningful characteristic that can be used to divide the pictures into two piles
    * For simplicitly: write down a question with a yes/no answer
* For each pile, select a meaningful characteristic that can be used to divide into two subpiles
    * Again, write down a question with a yes/no answer
    * The question can be different for each of the two piles
* Repeat until every pile only contains things that do/don't fly
* Somewhat similar to playing a game of "20 questions"

### Reflection
* _What was the first characteristic you used to divide the pictures? Why?_
* _What were the second characteristics you used to divide the pictures? Were they the same for each pile? Why or why not?_
* _Overall, how did you choose questions?_
* _What answer would you give for a previously unseen thing—e.g., a train? a pigeon? a kite?_
