# unit testing
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-10-04_

## Announcements
* Homework 4 due Thursday

## Outline
* Warm-up: top-down design
* Unit tests
* doctests

## Warm-up: top-down design
_Design a program that helps a user construct a monthly budget. The program should ask for a user’s annual income, fixed expenses (e.g., rent, groceries, phone), and desired allocation among variable expenses (e.g., clothing, travel). Assume 20% of a user’s annual income is put into savings. **Your design should consist of function definitions and docstrings; also, add a comment in a function's body if it should call one of the other functions. Do not write the function bodies.**_


```python
def get_income():
    """Determine monthly income"""

def total_fixed():
    """Determine total fixed expenses"""

def allocate_variable(leftover):
    """Allocate remaining income among variable expenses"""

def after_savings(income):
    """Determine savings"""

def main():
    """Ask for income, fixed expenses, and variable expenses and output budget details"""
```

## Unit tests
* Code that automatically checks whether a function returns the correct result
* Must be written by a person who knows what a function should do
* Multiple unit tests should be written for a function in order to test:
    * Common actual parameters
    * Boundary cases

## doctests

* Specific way of writing unit tests
* Include function call and expected output within docstring
* At top of file `import doctest`; at bottom of file call `doctest.testmod()`
* Example:


```python
import doctest

def funcA(w, x):
    """
    Computes the minimum
    
    >>> funcA(1, 2)
    1
    >>> funcA(2, 1)
    1
    >>> funcA(2, 2)
    2
    """
    if (w < x):
        return w
    else:
        return x

doctest.testmod()
```




    TestResults(failed=0, attempted=3)



* Cannot (easily) use doctests to test functions that require input
    * Ask for input only in main (or as few functions as possible)

### Practice

_Write 4 good doctests for each of the following functions:_


```python
#1)
def funcB(v):
    """Determines if a number is even"""
    return (v % 2) == 0
```


```python
def funcB(v):
    """
    Determines if a number is even
    
    >>> funcB(2)
    True
    >>> funcB(3)
    False
    >>> funcB(0)
    True
    >>> funcB(1)
    False
    """
    return (v % 2) == 0
```


```python
#2)
def funcC(n):
    """Rounds a number to the nearest multiple of ten"""
    p = n % 10
    if p <= 5:
        return n - p
    else:
        return n + (10 - p)
```


```python
#2)
def funcC(n):
    """
    Rounds a number to the nearest multiple of ten
    
    >>> funcC(13)
    10
    >>> funcC(27)
    30
    >>> funcC(30)
    30
    >>> funcC(45)
    40
    """
    p = n % 10
    if p <= 5:
        return n - p
    else:
        return n + (10 - p)
```


```python
#3)
def count_characters(paragraph):
    """Counts the number of characters in a paragraph"""
    return len(paragraph)
```


```python
#3)
def count_characters(paragraph):
    """
    Counts the number of characters in a paragraph
    
    >>> count_characters("Once upon a time, there lived a COSC 101 student. They loved programming.")
    73
    >>> count_characters("Once upon a time")
    16
    >>> count_characters("upon")
    4
    >>> count_characters("a")
    1
    """
    return len(paragraph)
```


```python
#4)
def count_words(paragraph):
    """Counts the number of words in a paragraph"""
    words = 0
    for char in paragraph:
        if char == ' ':
            words = words + 1
    words = words + 1 # Include last word, which won't have a space afterwards
    return words
```


```python
#4)
def count_words(paragraph):
    """
    Counts the number of words in a paragraph
    
    >>> count_words("Once upon a time, there lived a COSC 101 student. They loved programming.")
    13
    >>> count_words("They loved programming.")
    3
    >>> count_words("Hooray.")
    1
    >>> count_words(""Once upon a time, there lived a COSC 101 student.")
    10
    """
    words = 0
    for char in paragraph:
        if char == ' ':
            words = words + 1
    words = words + 1 # Include last word, which won't have a space afterwards
    return words
```


```python
#5)
def count_sentences(paragraph):
    """Counts the number of sentences in a paragraph"""
    sentences = 0
    for char in paragraph:
        if char == '.':
            sentences = sentences + 1
    return sentences
```


```python
#5)
def count_sentences(paragraph):
    """
    Counts the number of sentences in a paragraph
    
    >>> count_sentences("Once upon a time, there lived a COSC 101 student. They loved programming.")
    2
    >>> count_words("They loved programming.")
    1
    >>> count_sentences("Hooray.")
    1
    >>> count_sentences(""Once upon a time, there lived a COSC 101 student. They loved programming. Hooray.")
    3
    """
    sentences = 0
    for char in paragraph:
        if char == '.':
            sentences = sentences + 1
    return sentences
```

## Extra practice

_Implement the functions in the program you designed in the warm-up._


```python
def get_income():
    """Determine monthly income"""
    annual = float(input("What is your annual income? $"))
    monthly = annual/12
    print("Monthly income: $"+str(monthly))
    return monthly

def total_fixed():
    """Determine total fixed expenses"""
    print("Fixed expenses:")
    total = 0
    for expense in ["rent", "groceries", "phone plan"]:
        amount = float(input("How much is your "+expense+"? $"))
        total = total + amount
    print("Total fixed expenses: $"+str(total))
    return total

def allocate_variable(leftover):
    """Allocate remaining income among variable expenses"""
    print("Variable expenses:")
    for expense in ["clothing", "travel"]:
        print("You have $"+str(leftover)+" left to budget")
        amount = float(input("How much would you like to spend on "+expense+"? $"))
        if amount > leftover:
            print("You can only spend $"+str(leftover)+" on "+expense)
            amount = leftover
        leftover = leftover - amount
    print("You have $"+str(leftover)+" to spend on other things")

def after_savings(income):
    """Determine savings"""
    save = income * 0.2
    print("You should save $"+str(save))
    return income - save

def main():
    """Ask for income, fixed expenses, and variable expenses and output budget details"""
    income = get_income()
    leftover = after_savings(income)
    fixed = total_fixed()
    if (fixed > leftover):
        print("Your fixed expenses exceed your available income!")
    else:
        leftover = leftover - fixed
        allocate_variable(leftover)

main()
```

    What is your annual income? $ 24000


    Monthly income: $2000.0
    You should save $400.0
    Fixed expenses:


    How much is your rent? $ 800
    How much is your groceries? $ 400
    How much is your phone plan? $ 100


    Total fixed expenses: $1300.0
    Variable expenses:
    You have $300.0 left to budget


    How much would you like to spend on clothing? $ 150


    You have $150.0 left to budget


    How much would you like to spend on travel? $ 200


    You can only spend $150.0 on travel
    You have $0.0 to spend on other things
