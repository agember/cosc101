## Range

### Overview
* Function that generates a sequence of integers
* `range(NUM)` â€” generates a sequence of `NUM` integers from `0` to `NUM-1`
    * E.g., `range(3)` â†  `[0, 1, 2]`
* `range(START, STOP)` â€” generates a sequence of `STOP-START` integers from `START` to `STOP-1`
    * E.g., `range(2,5)` â†  `[2, 3, 4]`
* `range(START, STOP, INCREMENT)` â€” generates a sequence of integers from `START` to `(STOP-1)*INCREMENT`, with `INCREMENT` added to each successive integer
    * E.g., `range(2,8,2)` â†  `[2, 4, 6]`
* Sequence of integers is generated on-demand â€” use `list(range(...))` to get the full sequence

### Practice

_What sequence of integers is produced by each of the following invocations of range?_


```python
#1)
list(range(6))
```




    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]




```python
#2)
list(range(10, 15))
```




    [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]




```python
#3)
list(range(5, 10))
```




    [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]




```python
#4)
list(range(0, 7, 3))
```




    [0, 3, 6]




```python
#5)
list(range(20, 15, -1))
```




    [20, 19, 18, 17, 16]




```python
#6)
list(range(14, -15, -7))
```




    [14, 7, 0, -7, -14]



_What call to range would produce each of the following sequences of integers?_

\#1) `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`


```python
list(range(10, 51, 10))
```




    [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]



\#2) `[101, 102, 103, 104]`


```python
list(range(101, 105))
```




    [101, 102, 103, 104]



\#3) `[15, 12, 9, 6]`


```python
list(range(15, 5, -3))
```




    [15, 12, 9, 6]



\#4) `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`


```python
list(range(0, 11, 2))
```




    [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]



## Accumulator pattern

### Overview
* Process of iteratively updating a variable
* To use the accumulator pattern, you must know:
    * What do you want to compute?
    * What is its type?
    * How can you build it one piece at a time?
* Applying the pattern
    ```Python
    accumVar = 0 # initialize accumulator variable; use the correct type
    for i in range(10): # iterate desired number of times
        accumVar = accumVar + 1 # update accumulator variable
    print(accumVar) # value of accumVar after the loop is the final result
    ```
    
### Example: computing an average


```python
sum = 0
for i in range(4):
    sum += int(input("Enter a number: "))
avg = sum / 4
print(avg)
```

    Enter a number:  2
    Enter a number:  4
    Enter a number:  6
    Enter a number:  8

_What is the output of the following programs? If necessary, provide input of your choosing._


```python
#1)
f = 1
for i in range(1, 4):
    f = f * i
print(f)
```

    6



```python
#2)
word = input("Enter a word: ")
spell = ""
for c in word:
    spell += c + "-"
print(spell)
```

    Enter a word:  encyclopedia


    e-n-c-y-c-l-o-p-e-d-i-a-



```python
#3)
greeting = "Hello "
for part in ['first','last']:
    name = input("What is your " + part + " name? ")
    greeting = greeting + name + " "
print(greeting)
```

    What is your first name?  Clarence
    What is your last name?  Ellis


    Hello Clarence Ellis

## Mapping patterns to loops

### Process
1. Identify repeated tasks â€” tasks may not be _exactly_ the same
2. Determine which repeated tasks can be "collated"

    ![Collated vs uncollated](figures/for_loops/collated-vs-uncollated.png)

3. Determine how many times the "collated" tasks need to be repeated
4. Write the tasks, using the loop variable to accommodate _slight_ differences between repetitions

### Example


```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
dora = turtle.Turtle()
dora.left(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.right(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.left(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.right(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.left(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.right(90)
dora.forward(50)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
dora = turtle.Turtle()
for i in range(0, 3):
    dora.left(90)
    dora.forward(50)
    dora.right(90)
    dora.forward(50)
window.exitonclick()
```

### Practice
_Each of the following programs contains redundant code. Rewrite the program to use a loop and eliminate the redundancy._


```python
#1)
import random
die1 = random.randrange(0,6)
die2 = random.randrange(0,6)
die3 = random.randrange(0,6)
print("Die 1: " + str(die1))
print("Die 2: " + str(die2))
print("Die 3: " + str(die3))
```


```python
import random
for num in [1,2,3]:
    roll = random.randrange(0,6)
    print("Die " + str(num) + ": " + str(roll))
```


```python
#2)
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
crush = turtle.Turtle()
crush.forward(10)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(20)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(30)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(40)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(50)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(60)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(70)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(80)
crush.right(90)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
crush = turtle.Turtle()
for i in range(10, 90, 10):
    crush.forward(i)
    crush.right(90)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
#3)
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
ash = turtle.Turtle()
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(180)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
ash = turtle.Turtle()
ash.pensize(3)
for side in [1,2,3]:
    ash.left(120)
    ash.forward(100)
ash.left(180)
for side in [1,2,3]:
    ash.left(120)
    ash.forward(100)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
#4)
print("1 is odd")
print("2 is even")
print("3 is odd")
print("4 is even")
print("5 is odd")
print("6 is even")
```


```python
for num in range(1, 7):
    if (num % 2 == 0):
        print(num, "is even")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd")
```

## Extra practice
\#1) _Write a program that asks a user how many steps they walked each day of the week and computes their step total for the week._


```python
week_steps = 0
for day in ["Sun","Mon","Tues","Wed","Thurs","Fri","Sat"]:
    daily_steps = input("How many steps did you walk on "+day+"? ")
    week_steps += int(daily_steps)
print("You walked " + str(week_steps) + " this week")
```

\#2) _Write a program that asks for the dimensions of multiple rooms and computes the total square footage of a house or apartment._


```python
total_area = 0.0
for room in ["living room", "kitchen", "bedroom", "bathroom"]:
    length = float(input("What is the length of the " + room + "? "))
    width = float(input("What is the width of the " + room + "? "))
    room_area = length * width
    total_area += room_area
print("The total square footage is " + str(total_area))
```

\#3) _Write a program that flips a coin as many times as the user requested and outputs the percentage of flips that were heads._


```python
import random
# Ask for number of flips
flips = int(input("How many flips? "))
heads = 0
# Flip and count heads
for i in range(0, flips):
    coin = random.randint(0,1)
    if (coin == 0):
        heads += 1
# Display results
percent = heads/flips * 100
print(str(percent)+"% of the slips were heads")
```

\#4) _Write a program that asks for ten positive numbers and outputs the largest number._


```python
largest = 0
for i in range(0, 10):
    num = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
    if num > largest:
        largest = num
print("The largest number is", largest)
```
