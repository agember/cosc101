## Warm-up: warm-up from last class session

_Look at the feedback you received. Compare your answers to the answers below. We'll review the problems as a class._

_What is the output of the following program? Assume the user enters `frog` and `20` for the inputs._


```python
word = input("What did you see? ")
print("That is a", type(word))
lower = 10
upper = lower + 20
lower = len(word)
print("I saw", str(lower) + "-" + str(upper), "of them, not", lower - upper)
count = input("How many" + word + "s did you see?")
updated = str(lower) + count
print("I also saw", updated, type(count))
updated = upper + int(count)
print("I wish I saw", updated, word, "s")
```

```
What did you see? frog
That is a <class 'str'>
I saw 4-30 of them, not -26
How manyfrogs did you see?20
I also saw 420 <class 'str'>
I wish I saw 50 frog s
```

_Write a program that asks a user for their age and outputs the year they were born, how old they will be in 2050, and in what year they will twice their current age._


```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
born = 2024 - age
print("You were born in", born)
expected = 2050 - 2024 + age
print("You will be", expected, "in 2050")
twice = age + 2024
print("You will be twice as old in", twice)
```

```
How old are you?  37
You were born in 1987
You will be 63 in 2050
You will be twice as old in 2098
```

## Functions (from last class session)

_Complete the Functions problems on the worksheet from the previous class session_

## Scope

* Recall: a variable is a vessel for a value
* Recall: variables only exist within a paticular function
* Proper terminology
    * Argument – included in the function call; can be values, variables, or expressions (e.g., mathematical operation or another function call)
    * Parameter – listed in function definition; treat like a variable
    * Arguments are **passed** to the function --> the values codified by the arguments are stored in the parameters
* Modifying one variable does not change other variables --> modifying a parameter does not change the argument


```python
def demo(a: int, b: int):
    print("a is", a)
    print("b is", b)
    #cannot use (e.g., print) n
    b = b * 2
    print("now b is", b)

def main():
    n = 5
    print("n is", n)
    demo(1, n)
    #cannot use (e.g., print) a or b
    print("n is still", n)

main()
```

    n is 5
    a is 1
    b is 5
    now b is 10
    n is still 5


<div style="height:10em;"></div>

* Even if you use the same parameter or variable name in two different functions, they are not the same parameter or variable!


```python
def demo(a: int, n: int):
    print("a is", a)
    print("n is", n)
    n = n * 2
    print("now n is", n)

def main():
    n = 5
    print("n is", n)
    demo(1, n)
    print("n is still", n)

main()
```

    n is 5
    a is 1
    n is 5
    now n is 10
    n is still 5


<div style="height:5em;"></div>

* How do we modify a value inside a function and have that reflected outside of the function?

## Return values


```python
def deposit(balance: float, amount: float) -> None:
    balance = balance + amount
    print("Balance: $" + str(balance))

def main() -> None:
    total = 50.0
    print("Starting balance: $" + str(total))
    add1 = float(input("First deposit: $"))
    deposit(total, add1)
    add2 = float(input("Second deposit: $"))
    deposit(total, add2)
    print("Ending balance: $" + str(total))

main()
```

    Starting balance: $50.0


    First deposit: $ 25


    Balance: $75.0


    Second deposit: $ 10


    Balance: $60.0


    Withdrawal: $ 20


    Balance: $30.0
    Final balance: $50.0


<div style="height:10em;"></div>

* Use `return` to provide a value **from** a function
    * Recall: arguments and parameters provide a value **to** a function
* Proper terminology
    * Callee – function that was called
    * Caller – function that made the call
    * Caller passes arguments to the callee
    * Callee returns to the caller


```python
def deposit(balance: float, amount: float) -> None:
    balance = balance + amount
    print("Balance: $" + str(balance))
    return balance

def main() -> None:
    total = 50.0
    print("Starting balance: $" + str(total))
    add1 = float(input("First deposit: $"))
    deposit(total, add1)
    add2 = float(input("Second deposit: $"))
    deposit(total, add2)
    print("Ending balance: $" + str(total))

main()
```

* Caller should store (in a variable) or print the return value


```python
def deposit(balance: float, amount: float) -> None:
    balance = balance + amount
    print("Balance: $" + str(balance))
    return balance

def main() -> None:
    total = 50.0
    print("Starting balance: $" + str(total))
    add1 = float(input("First deposit: $"))
    new_total1 = deposit(total, add1)
    add2 = float(input("Second deposit: $"))
    new_total2 = deposit(new_tota1, add2)
    print("Ending balance: $" + str(new_total2))

main()
```

* Reuse variables when appropriate


```python
def deposit(balance: float, amount: float) -> None:
    balance = balance + amount
    print("Balance: $" + str(balance))
    return balance

def main() -> None:
    total = 50.0
    print("Starting balance: $" + str(total))
    add1 = float(input("First deposit: $"))
    total = deposit(total, add1)
    add2 = float(input("Second deposit: $"))
    total = deposit(total, add2)
    print("Ending balance: $" + str(total))

main()
```

_What is the output of each of the following programs?_


```python
def magic(a: int) -> None:
    return a * 2

def main() -> None:
    x = 5
    print("x was " + str(x))
    x = magic(x)
    print("now it is " + str(x))

main()
```

    x was 5
    now it is 10


```





```


```python
def average(num1: int, num2: int, num3: int) -> float:
    total = num1 + num2 + num3
    return total / 3

def main() -> None:
    result = average(5, 10, 30)
    print("average =", result)
    average(3, 12, result)
    print("average =", result)

main()
```

    average = 15.0
    average = 15.0


```





```

_Write a function `convert_to_meters` that takes a distance in feet and inches and computes the distance in meters. Note: 1 foot is 12 inches and 1 foot is 0.3058 meters._


```python
def convert_to_meters(feet: int, inches: int) -> float:
    feet = feet + inches / 12
    return feet * 0.3058
```

```







```

_Write a function `convert_to_dozen` that takes a quantity and converts the quantity to dozens, rounding up. For example, `convert_to_dozen(20)` should return `2`, because two dozen is 24 (whereas one dozen is only 12)._


```python
def convert_to_dozen(quantity: int) -> int:
    dozen = quantity // 12
    remain = quantity % 12
    extra = (remain + 11) // 12
    return dozen + extra
```

```








```
