## for loops

_What is the output of each of the following programs?_


```python
#1)
for num in [5,4,3,2,1]:
    print(num)
```

```
```


```python
#2)
for tree in ['apple', 'orange', 'pear']:
    print(tree)
```

```



```


```python
#3)
for num in [1,2,3,4,5,6]:
    if num%2 == 0:
        print(num)
```

```\


```


```python
#4)
for num in [1,2,3]:
    result = num
print(result)
```

```


```


```python
#5)
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
mock = turtle.Turtle() # Mock is a functional character in the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
for side in ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h']:
    mock.right(45)
    mock.forward(100)
window.exitonclick()
```

```




```


```python
#6)
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
spotty = turtle.Turtle() # Spotty is a fictional character in the book Old Mother West Wind
spotty.pensize(3)
for side in ['ul','ll','lr','ur']:
    spotty.left(90)
    spotty.forward(100)
    spotty.left(90)
    spotty.forward(100)
    spotty.left(90)
    spotty.forward(100)
    spotty.left(90)
    spotty.forward(100)
    spotty.left(90)
window.exitonclick()
```

```

list(range(6))
```

```
```


```python
#2)
list(range(10, 15))
```

```
```


```python
#3)
list(range(5, 10))
```

```
```


```python
#4)
list(range(0, 7, 3))
```

```
```


```python

```Python

















```

\#2) _Write a number guessing game program: The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 20. The user has 5 chances to guess the correct number. When a user makes a guess, the program should tell them if their number is correct, too high, or too low._
