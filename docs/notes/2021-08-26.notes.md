# Outline
* Getting to know you
* Course topics
* Syllabus higlights

# Getting to know Aaron
* My full name is...Aaron Gember-Jacobson
* I would prefer you call me...Aaron
* My personal pronouns are...he/him/his
* I decided to teach this course because...programming is fun, and I enjoy the “aha” moments that occur when students are learning to program.
* Do you have any experience with computer science?...Yes, I took my first CS course junior year of high school (18 years ago)
* Describe two or three things (i.e., activities, people, places, animals, worthy causes, books, etc.) you currently care most about and why?
    * My wife (Emily) and kids (Henry, 5; Molly, 3), because they always love and support me
    * Walking to campus, because it gives me time to listen to podcasts and clear my mind
    * Creating an equitable and inclusive learning environment, because I want to counteract systems of power and privilege within the field of computer science and within Colgate

# Getting to know you

# What is "Introduction to Computing I"?
* "**Computer science** is the study of algorithmic processes and the machines that carry out these processes." -- Colgate Catalog
* "An **algorithm** is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration."  -- How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
* "**Programming** is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in a notation (a program) that can be followed by a computer."  -- How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
* **Introduction** ⇒ no prior programming experience required
* Algorithms and programming are only two aspects of computer science; CS also involves:
    * Creativity --- many ways to solve a problem with different trade-offs
    * Data --- gathering, organizing, analyzing; processed by programs
    * Abstraction --- “hiding” some details of the solution, e.g., how the hardware works
* Areas of computer science
    * Networking
    * Artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing
    * Programming languages
    * Architecture --- design of computing hardware (e.g., CPU)
    * Security
    * Human-computer interaction (HCI)
    * Graphics
    * And more...
* Computer science intersects with lots of other disciplines, such as:
    * Biology --- searching for patterns in genomic data
    * History --- analyzing ancient texts
    * Geology --- earthquake modeling
    * Political science --- sentiment analysis; predicting election outcomes
    * Astronomy --- analyzing telescope images
    * Finance --- high-frequency trading

# Syllabus higlights
* Before each class, read listed textbook sections and answer pre-class questions on Moodle
    * For Monday: Read sections 1.1-1.13 and answer pre-class questions
* Class meetings: warm-up problems, working through examples, clarifying concepts, individual and small group problem solving  
    * Everyone is expected to speak in class; it is okay to be wrong -- I also do things wrong!
* Labs start next week
* Reflections on DEI in relation to CS
* Time management: start assignments when they are released and work over multiple shorter sessions
* Deadlines: I will be reasonably flexible as long as you are responsible
* Academic honesty: I want you to succeed, and I will do everything I can to help you; violating the academic honesty expectations almost always leads to a bad experience for you and me
* Feedback on the course is always welcome
