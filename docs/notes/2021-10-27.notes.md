* Warm-up
* string methods
* string formatting

## Warm-up
_Write a function called pig_latin that takes a single word and translates the word to pig latin by moving the first letter to the end of the word and adding “ay” to the end. For example:_
* `pig_latin('pig')` returns `'igpay'`
* `pig_latin('latin')` returns `'atinlay'`


```python
def pig_latin(word):
    """
    Translate a word to pig latin
    
    >>> pig_latin('pig')
    'igpay'
    >>> pig_latin('latin')
    'atinlay'
    """
    return word[1:] + word[0] + "ay"
```

## String methods

## Overview
* String operators
    * `+` — concetantes two strings
    * `*` — repeats a string
    * `in` — true if one string exists within another string, otherwise false
    * `not in` — true if one string does not exist within another string, otherwise false
* Built-in functions
    * `len` — returns the length of a string
    * `ord` — returns the numeric code corresponding to a character
    * `chr` — returns the character corresponding to a numeric code
* String methods are functions that are applied to a specific string, similar to working with a `Turtle` object


```python
title = 'Still I rise'
print(title.upper())
```

    STILL I RISE


* Common methods
    * `upper`, `lower` — converts all characters to upper or lower case
    * `strip`, `lstrip`, `rstrip` — removes leading/trailing whitespace (space, tab, newline)
    * `replace` — replace all occurrences of one substring with another
    * `find`, `rfind` — get index where substring is found
    
### Practice

_Complete the following functions_:


```python
#1)
def eecummings(poem):
    """
    Converts a poem to lowercase
    
    >>> eecummings("Still I rise")
    'still i rise'
    """
    return poem.lower()
```


```python
#2)
def emphasize(phrase, word):
    """
    Make the first occurrence of word in phrase uppercase
    
    >>> emphasize('"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers', "all")
    '"We ALL have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers'
    >>> emphasize('"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers', "gifts")
    '"We all have different GIFTS, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers'
    >>> emphasize('"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers', "Mister")
    '"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers'
    """
    start = phrase.find(word)
    if (start >= 0):
        end = start + len(word)
        return phrase[:start] + phrase[start:end].upper() + phrase[end:]
    else:
        return phrase
```


```python
#3)
def bleep(phrase, swear_words):
    """
    Replace any words in phrase in the list of swear_words with BLEEP
    
    >>> bleep("Oh crap!", ["shit", "crap"])
    'Oh BLEEP!'
    >>> bleep("Oh crap, this shit doesn't work!", ["shit", "crap"])
    "Oh BLEEP, this BLEEP doesn't work!"
    """
    for swear in swear_words:
        phrase = phrase.replace(swear, "BLEEP")
    return phrase
```

## String formatting

### Overview
* _Assume I wanted to write a function called `word_length` that takes a single word and prints the word and its length. For example: `word_length('rain')` should output `"rain is 4 characters long!"`. How would I write the body of the function?_
* _Now assume I wanted `word_length('rain')` to output `"rain has length 4!"` How would I change the body of the function?_
* Simpler alternative: string `format` method
    * Create a string that contains curly places as placeholders for values
    * Call `format` on the string with a list of values to fill-in the placeholders


```python
word = "rain"
print("{} has length {}!".format(word, len(word)))
```

    rain has length 4!


### Practice

_Complete the following functions_:


```python
#1)
def y2k(date):
    """
    Converts a date in the format 'Month DD, YY' to 'DD Month 19YY'
    
    >>> y2k("March 02, 20")
    '02 March 1920'
    >>> y2k("January 01, 00")
    '01 January 1900'
    """
    year = date[-2:]
    day = date[-6:-4]
    month_end = date.find(" ")
    month = date[:month_end]
    return "{} {} 19{}".format(day, month, year)
```

_Complete the following functions_:


```python
def slice(phrase, word):
    """
    Return the slice notation (as a string) for extracting word from phrase
    
    >>> slice("A piece of pizza", "of")
    '[8:10]'
    >>> slice("A piece of pizza", "pie")
    '[2:5]'
    >>> slice("A piece of pizza", "A")
    '[:1]'
    >>> slice("A piece of pizza", "pizza")
    '[11:]'
    """
    start = phrase.find(word)
    end = start + len(word)
    if start == 0:
        start = ""
    if end == len(phrase):
        end = ""
    return "[{}:{}]".format(start, end)
```
