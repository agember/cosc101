```python
column_names = []
data = load_data('things.csv', column_names)
labels = select_single_column(data, 1)
features = select_columns(data,2,6)
```


```python
from sklearn import tree
```


```python
dtree = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
```


```python
dtree.fit(features, labels)
```


```python
print(tree.export_text(dtree, feature_names=column_names[2:6]))
```


```python
train_features = [0, 0, 0, 8]
```


```python
pigeon_features = [1, 0, 2, 0]
kite_features = [0, 0, 0, 0]
predict_features = [pigeon_features, kite_features]
predictions = dtree.predict(predict_features)
print("Pigeon", predictions[0])
print("Kite", predictions[1])
```
