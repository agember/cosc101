## Announcements
* Homework #9 due Thursday @ 5pm

## Warm-up
*What is the output of the following program?*


```python
opposites = { 'hot' : 'cold', 'tall' : 'short', 'up' : 'down'}
opposites2 = {}
for word in opposites:
    word2 = opposites[word]
    opposites2[word2] = word
print(opposites2)
```

```




```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems.

## Aliasing

*What is the output of the following programs?*


```python
#1)
zipcodes = { 90210: 'Beverly Hills, CA', 10001 : 'New York, NY' }
cities = zipcodes
zipcodes[13346] = 'Hamilton, NY'
newyork = zipcodes.copy()
del newyork[90210]
print(zipcodes is cities)
print(zipcodes == cities)
print(zipcodes is newyork)
print(zipcodes == newyork)
```

```






```


```python
#2)
def expand(prefixes):
    prefixes['India'] = 91
    codes = prefixes.copy()
    codes[61] = 'Australia'
    return codes

areacodes = { 'United States' : 1, 'China' : 86 }
expandcodes = expand(areacodes)
print(areacodes)
del areacodes['United States']
print(expandcodes)
```

```




```


```python
#3)
molecules = { }
molecules['water'] = {'H' : 2 , 'O' : 1}
molecules['acid'] = {'H' : 2, 'S' : 1, 'O' : 4 }
molecules['agua'] = molecules['water']
chosen = molecules['agua']
chosen['O'] = 2
print(molecules)
```

```





```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the above questions; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems.

## Dictionary manipulation patterns

\#1) *Write a function called `char_count` that takes a string and returns a dictionary that maps characters to the number of times the character occurs in the string. For example: `char_count('basketball')` should return*
```
{'b': 2, 'a': 2, 's': 1, 'k': 1, 'e': 1, 't': 1, 'l': 2}
```

```















```

\#2) *Write a function called `group_data` that takes a list of names and data items (e.g., `[name1,data1, name2,data2,...]`) and returns a dictionary that maps names to lists of corresponding data items. For example:*
```
group_data(['apples','5','pears','8','oranges','3','pears','2'])
```
*should return*
```
{'apples' : ['5'], 'pears' : ['8','2'], 'oranges': ['3']}
```

```
















```

\#3) *Assume each line of the file `synonyms.txt` contains a word followed by one or more synonyms, e.g.:*
```
small little compact tiny
large big huge immense vast
tall large towering 
```
*Write a function called `load_synonyms` that reads the file and returns a dictionary containing the words and their corresponding list of synonyms, e.g.:*
```
{'small' : ['little','compact','tiny'], 
 'large' : ['big','huge','immense','vast'], 
 'tall' : ['large','towering']}
```

```














```

## Extra practice
*What is the output of the following programs?*


```python
#1)
babies = {'dog': 'puppy', 'cat': 'kitten', 'cow': 'calf'}
for adult in babies:
    baby = babies[adult]
    print("A baby", adult, "is called a", baby)
```

```





```


```python
#2)
holidays = {'Nov': {4: "Diwali", 11 : "Veteran's Day", 25: "Thanksgiving", 28: "1st night of Hanukkah"}, 
            'Dec': {21: "Winter Solstice", 25: "Christmas"}}
for month in holidays:
    print(month)
    month = holidays[month]
    for day in month:
        holiday = month[day]
        print(day,holiday)
```
