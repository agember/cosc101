## Warm-up
_Each of the following programs contains redundant code. Rewrite the program to use a loop and eliminate the redundancy._


```python
#1)
import random
die1 = random.randrange(0,6)
die2 = random.randrange(0,6)
die3 = random.randrange(0,6)
print("Die 1: " + str(die1))
print("Die 2: " + str(die2))
print("Die 3: " + str(die3))
```


```python
import random
for num in [1,2,3]:
    roll = random.randrange(0,6)
    print("Die " + str(num) + ": " + str(roll))
```


```python
#2)
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
crush = turtle.Turtle()
crush.forward(10)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(20)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(30)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(40)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(50)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(60)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(70)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(80)
crush.right(90)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
crush = turtle.Turtle()
for i in range(10, 90, 10):
    crush.forward(i)
    crush.right(90)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
#3)
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
ash = turtle.Turtle()
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(180)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
ash = turtle.Turtle()
ash.pensize(3)
for side in [1,2,3]:
    ash.left(120)
    ash.forward(100)
ash.left(180)
for side in [1,2,3]:
    ash.left(120)
    ash.forward(100)
window.exitonclick()
```


```python
#4)
print("1 is odd")
print("2 is even")
print("3 is odd")
print("4 is even")
print("5 is odd")
print("6 is even")
```


```python
for num in range(1, 7):
    if (num % 2 == 0):
        print(num, "is even")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd")
```

## String indexing

### Overview
* _How can we iterate through a string character by character?_ — using a for loop


```python
word = "dog"
for character in word:
    print(character)
```

    d
    o
    g


* Can also reference characters by index


```python
word = "dog"
length = len(word)
for index in range(length):
    character = word[index]
    print(character)
```

    d
    o
    g


* Notice: first character has index `0`, last character has index `length-1`
* Can also use negative indices — last character has index `-1`, first character has index `-length`

### Practice

Assume the following code has been executed:


```python
animal = "cat"
```

_What will each of the programs output?_


```python
#1)
stop = len(animal)
for index in range(1, stop):
    print(animal[index])
```

    a
    t



```python
#2)
stop = len(animal) + 1
for index in range(1, stop):
    index = index * -1
    print(animal[index])
```

    t
    a
    c



```python
#3)
stop = len(animal)
animal2 = ""
for index in range(stop):
    animal2 = animal2 + "," + animal[index]
print(animal2)
```

    ,c,a,t



```python
#4)
stop = len(animal)
animal3 = ""
for index in range(stop):
    animal3 = animal[index] + animal3
print(animal3)
```
