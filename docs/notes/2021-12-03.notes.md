## Announcements
* Homework #10 due Thursday @ 5pm
* DEI reflection due Monday @ 11pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* What is ML?
* Key terms
* Types of ML
* Decision trees

## Warm-up
_What does every recursive function need?_

* Base case
* Recursive case
    * Divide
    * Recurse — function calls itself
    * Combine

## What is machine learning (ML)?
* _What is machine learning?_ — deriving an algorithm from data, instead of being explicitly programmed
* Example: recognizing hand-written digits
    * Assume an image contains a hand-written digit
    * Recall: _How are images represented?_ — as a grid of pixels
    * If a pixel is black, it is part of the digit; if a pixel is white it is not part of the digit
    * _Given an image, how would you write an algorithm to determine if the image contains the digit 1?_ — look for a vertical sequence of black pixels; all other pixels should be white
        * _What if someone writes a 1 at a slight angle?_ — the digit won't be detected
        * _Could we fix this?_ — write a more complex algorithm that doesn't require the line to be strictly vertical
    * _Given an image, how would you write an algorithm to determine if the image contains the digit 7?_ — look for a horizontal sequence of black pixels whose right side intersects the top of a diagonal sequence of black pixels; all other pixels should be white
    * _Given an image, how would you write an algorithm to determine if the image contains the digit 5?_ — this is a hard problem for a human
* Machine learning approach: the computer "writes" the algorithm based on examples of hand-written digits
    * Algorithm learns probabilities that certain pixels are black or white for certain digits
    * For exmaple, the corners of a hand-written 1 will always be white, whereas the upper-right corner of a hand-written 5 will be black with highly probability
    * Given a new image, the highest probability digit is identified

## Key terms
* Model — the "algorithm" that is derived from data
    * For example, the probabilities of each pixel being black for each hand-written digit
* Training — the act of constructing a model
* Training data — information used to construct the model
* Features — characteristics of each data item
* Testing — the act of measuring a model's accuracy
* Testing data — information used to evaluate the model's accuracy; typically the data is split into training and testing

## Types of ML algorithms
* Supervised
    * Each data item is assigned a label (e.g., digit that an image contains)
    * Create a model that can predict the label for a previously unseen data item
* Unsupervised
    * Data items are not labeled
    * Create groupings of similar data items—e.g., images containing a 1 digit should be grouped together, but the algorithm does not know that the images contain a 1 digit
* Reinforcement learning
    * Take actions based on a model
    * Receive rewards/punishments based on the actions
    * Update the model based on rewards/punshiments
    * Repeat

## Decision trees
* Similar to nested if-statements
* At each node in a decision tree, a decision is made (based on features of the data) and the appropriate branch is taken
* When there are no more branches, a final outcome (e.g., a label) is decided

### Activity
* Pictures of things
* Manually construct a decision tree to decide _does it fly?_
* Start with a single pile of pictures
* Select one meaningful characteristic that can be used to divide the pictures into two piles
    * For simplicitly: write down a question with a yes/no answer
* For each pile, select a meaningful characteristic that can be used to divide into two subpiles
    * Again, write down a question with a yes/no answer
    * The question can be different for each of the two piles
* Repeat until every pile only contains things that do/don't fly
* Somewhat similar to playing a game of "20 questions"

### Reflection
* _What was the first characteristic you used to divide the pictures? Why?_
* _What were the second characteristics you used to divide the pictures? Were they the same for each pile? Why or why not?_
* _Overall, how did you choose questions?_
* _What answer would you give for a previously unseen thing—e.g., a train?_
