## Announcements
* Exam 1 in class on Wednesday
    * Combination of code reading and code writing
    * Study by solving problems (all linked from Moodle): in-class worksheets; Prof. Davis' class worksheets; exam 1 practice problems
* Revisions to up to two parts from Homework 1 and/or 2 due Thursday @ 11:59pm

## Exam topics
* Computational thinking (decomposition, patterns, abstraction)
* Types (int, str, float, bool)
* Expressions, variables, and assignment
* Interactive programs (input, print)
* Errors & debugging
* Functions (defining, calling, parameters, return, docstrings)
* String and list indexing

## Code tracing

_What is the output of the following programs?_


```python
def main() -> None:
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = a + 3
    a = b
    b = b + 1
    print(a, b, c)

main()
```

```


```python
def main() -> None:
    a = 'kangaroo'
    b = 'penguin'
    print(a[1] + b[1])
    print(a[-1] + b[len(b)-1])

main()
```

    on

```


```python
def main() -> None:
    u = "bat"
    v = ""
    w = ""
    for i in range(len(u)):
        v = v + str(i) + u[i]
        w = u[i] + w
    print(v)
    print(w)

main()
```

```python
def main() -> None:
    a = ''
    b = str(8)
    for c in range(5):
        a = a + str(c)
    for c in range(6, 0, -2):
        b = b + str(c)
    print(a,b,c)

main()
```

    print(g + 3)

def main() -> None:

## Writing code

_Write a program that computes how much an employee earns in a week. The program should ask for the employee’s hourly pay rate and the number of hours they worked each day of the week._


```python
def main() -> None:
    rate = float(input('Hourly rate? '))
    hours = 0
    for day in ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat']:
        daily_hours = int(input('Hours worked on ' + day + '? '))
        hours = hours + daily_hours
    print('Weekly pay: $' + str(hours * rate))

main()
```

```















```

_Write a program that asks for a pizza’s diameter (in centimeters) and number of slices and computes the area of each slice. (Hint: The area of a circle is 𝜋r².)_


```python
import math
def main() -> None:
    diameter = int(input('Diameter? '))
    slices = int(input('Slices? '))
    total_area = math.pi * (diameter/2) ** 2
    slice_area = total_area / slices
    print('Each slice is', slice_area, 'square cm')

main()
```

```
















```

_Write a program that asks for the number of rows and columns and draws a grid of that size. For example:_
```
How many rows? 3
How many columns? 5
+-+-+-+-+-+
| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+
| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+
| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+
```


```python
def print_line(cols: int) -> None:
    line = "+" + ("-+" * cols)
    print(line)

def print_cells(cols: int) -> None:
    cells = "|" + (" |" * cols)
    print(cells)

def main() -> None:
    rows = int(input("How many rows? "))
    cols = int(input("How many columns? "))
    for i in range(rows):
        print_line(cols)
        print_cells(cols)
    print_line(cols)

main()
```

    How many rows?  3
    How many columns?  5


    +-+-+-+-+-+
    | | | | | |
    +-+-+-+-+-+
    | | | | | |
    +-+-+-+-+-+
    | | | | | |
    +-+-+-+-+-+


```
