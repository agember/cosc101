# Iteration: patterns
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-10-16_

## Announcements
* Homework 5 due tomorrow @ 11:59pm

## Warm-up
_Write a function called `lazy_divide` that takes a dividend and a divisor (both integers) and uses subtraction to compute the result of performing integer division._


```python
def lazy_divide(dividend, divisor):
    """
    >>> lazy_divide(6, 2)
    3
    >>> lazy_divide(16, 4)
    4
    >>> lazy_divide(7, 2)
    3
    """
    quotient = 0
    while (dividend >= divisor):
        dividend = dividend - divisor
        quotient = quotient + 1
    return quotient
```

```











```

## Loop patterns

### Accumulator pattern

* You want to build a string or calculate a total in steps --> use a loop
* On each iteration, the loop should integrate the next value into the exist value
* Applying the pattern
    * Assign an initial value (e.g., `0` or `""`) to the the accumulator variable befor the loop
    * Update the accumulator variable's value in the body of the loop
    * After the loop finishes (i.e., all iterations have completed), the variable should hold the final desired value
* Example


```python
import random
def security_code(digits):
    code = ""
    while len(code) < digits:
        digit = random.randint(0,9)
        code = code + str(digit)
    return code
print(security_code(6))
```

### Sentinel pattern

* You want to prompt a user for input multiple times, but you don’t know how many times to prompt the user --> use a while loop
* To signal they are done entering input, the user enters a predetermined value (e.g., `0`) called the _sentinel value_, which causes the loop to terminte
* Applying the pattern
    * Assign the value `True` to a variable (called the _sentinel variable_) before the while loop
    * Use the sentinel variable as the condition for the while loop
    * In the loop body, prompt for input
    * If the user entered the sentinel value, re-assign the value `False` to the sentinel variable; Otherwise, process the input as desired
* Example:


```python
def main() -> None:
    sentinel = True
    while sentinel:
        num = int(input("Enter a positive number (or -1 if finished):"))
        if num == -1:
            sentinel = False
        else:
           print("You entered", num)
    print("Done")
main()
```

    Enter a positive number (or -1 if finished): 5


    You entered 5


    Enter a positive number (or -1 if finished): 3


    You entered 3


    Enter a positive number (or -1 if finished): 9


    You entered 9


    Enter a positive number (or -1 if finished): -1


    Done


### Polling pattern

* You want to prompt a user for input and keep re-prompting until they enter a valid value --> use a while loop
* The loop condition should check whether the entered value is invalid
* Applying the pattern
    * Initialize a variable (called the input variable) to an invalid input value (e.g., `""`)
    * The condition for the while loop should check if the value is invalid (e.g., is not a specific character)
    * In the loop body, prompt for input and assign the input to the input variable
* Example


```python
def get_choice(choices):
    choice = ""
    while choice not in choices:
        choice = input("Choose " + str(choices) + ": ")
    return choice
print(get_choice(["A", "B", "C"]))
```

    Choose ['A', 'B', 'C']:  D
    Choose ['A', 'B', 'C']:  X
    Choose ['A', 'B', 'C']:  B


    B


### Choosing a pattern

_For each of the following scenarios, indicate which loop pattern you should apply. (You **do not** need to write any code.)_

_Write a function called `acronym` that takes a multi-word phrase and returns a string containing the first letter of each word in the phrase._

Accumulator pattern — accumulate a string

```
```

_Write a function called `ask_questions` that takes a yes/no question and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the user answered yes or no, respectively._

Polling pattern — user must answer yes or no

```
```

_Create a modified `main` function for homework 4 that **does not** ask for the number of customers ahead of time and **does not** print the total amount billed after all customers' information has been entered._

Sentinel pattern — continue asking for customer information until user enters billing code `f` (for finished)

```
```

_Create a modified `one_customer` function for homework 4 that asks the user to enter a new billing code and/or meter reading if they enter an invalid billing code or meter reading._

Polling pattern — user must enter a valid billing code and meter readings

```
```

_Write a function called `get_day_of_year` that prompts the user to enter a day of the year and returns a valid day of the year (1 through 365) as an integer._

Polling pattern — user must enter a number between 1 and 365 (inclusive)

```
```

_Write a function called `get_max_digit` that takes a string of digits and returns the largest digit. For example, `get_max_digit("3142")` should return `4`._

Accumulator pattern — "accumulate" the max

```
```

_Write a function called `total_caffeine` that asks the user to enter the milligrams (mg) of caffeine for each beverage they consumed in a day until the user indicates they are done consuming beverages. The function should return the total caffeine consumed._

Sentinel pattern — continue asking for caffeine amount until user enters `-1`

Accumulator pattern — accumulating total caffeine consumed

```
```
