# Conditionals: nesting
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-10-07_

## Announcements
* Homework 4 due Thursday at 11:59pm

## Nested conditionals

* The statements that are executed when a condition is true (or false) may include another if statement

_Example_


```python
x = int(input("x="))
y = int(input("y="))
if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        print("x is positive, y is positive")
    else:
        print("x is positive, y is negative")
else:
    print("x is not positive")
print(x, "+", y, "=", x+y)
```

_Write a program that asks the user for their age. If the user is at least 18 years old, then the program should ask which presidential candidate they plan to vote for. If the user enters `Harris`, the program should output `Democrat`; if the user enters `Trump`, the program should output `Republican`; if the user enters something else, the program should output `Independent`. If the user is younger than 18, the program should output `You are too young`._


```python
def main() -> None:
    age = int(input("How old are you? "))
    if (age >= 18):
        candidate = input("Which candidate do you plan to vote for? ")
        if (candidate == "Harris"):
            print("Democrat")
        elif (candidate == "Trump"):
            print("Republican")
        else:
            print("Independent")
    else:
        print("You are too young")
main()
```

```













```

_Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
def main() -> None:
    a = int(input("a="))
    if a >= 50:
        if (a >= 100):
            print("Extra")
        print("Large")
    else:
        if (a < 10):
            print ("Small")
        else:
            print("Medium")
main()
```

```








```

_What will the program output if a user enters `25`?_

`Medium`

```
```

_What will the program output if a user enters `125`?_

```
Extra
Large
```

```
```

### Extra practice

_For the following program, which code blocks will be executed when the listed conditions are true?_

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
    if condition 2:
        code block B
    elif condition 3:
        code block C
else:
    code block D
```

_When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

A, B

```
```

_When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

D

```
```

_When only condition 1 is True_

A

```
```

_Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
def main() -> None:
    i = int(input("i="))
    j = int(input("j="))
    if i > 5:
        if j > 15:
            print("A")
    else:
        if j > 15:
            print("B")
    if i > 10:
        print("C")
main()
```

```





```

_What will the program output if a user enters `5` and `20`?_

`B`

```
```

_What will the program output if a user enters `10` and `40`?_

`A`

```
```

_What will the program output if a user enters `20` and `5`?_

`C`

```
```

_For the following program, which code blocks will be executed when the listed conditions are true?_

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
    if condition 2:
        code block B
    else:
        code block C
if condition 3:
    code block D
```

_When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

A, B

```
```

_When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

D

```
```

_When only condition 1 is True_

A, C

```
```
