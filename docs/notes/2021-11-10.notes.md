## Announcements
* Homework 8 due tomorrow at 5pm
* Exam 3 next week Wednesday
    * Study materials posted on Moodle

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Writing files
* Debugging file reading/writing

## Warm-up
Write a function called `odd_lines` that takes the name of a file and returns a list containing the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. line of the file.


```python
def odd_lines(filename):
    '''
    Construct a list containing the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. line of the file
    
    >>> odd_lines('warm-up.txt')
    ['First\\n', 'Third\\n', 'Fifth\\n']
    '''
    infile = open(filename, 'r')
    line = infile.readline() # Read first line
    lines = []
    while line != '': # Repeat until end of file
        lines = lines + [line]
        line = infile.readline() # Skip a line
        line = infile.readline()
    infile.close()
    return lines
```

## Writing files

### Overview
* What does a program need to do to write data to a file?
    * Open the file in write mode
    * Call the `write` function on the file object
    * Call the `close` function on the file object


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'w')
myfile.write('Hello, file!\n')
myfile.close()
```

* You must explicitly include newline characters in the string passed to write if you want the next string you write to appear on the next line of the file
    * write **does not** automatically include newlines like print does
* If you do not call close, part of the data may be lost
    * Python stores data in a temporary buffer before writing it to the file; close ensures all data in the buffer is added to the file

## Debugging file reading/writing
Assume the file `months.txt` contains the following data:
```
January
February
March
April
May
June
July
August
September
October
November
December
```

*Identify and correct the error(s) in each of the following programs.*


```python
#1) Print the contents of the file
months = open('months.txt', 'r')
for line in months:
    print(line)
```

    January
    
    February
    
    March
    
    April
    
    May
    
    June
    
    July
    
    August
    
    September
    
    October
    
    November
    
    December
    



```python
#1) Print the contents of the file
# CORRECTED
months = open('months.txt', 'r')
for line in months:
    print(line.strip()) # Need to strip newline to avoid extra blank lines
months.close() # Need to close file
```

    January
    February
    March
    April
    May
    June
    July
    August
    September
    October
    November
    December



```python
#2) Print the number of characters in each month
months = open('months.txt', 'r')
while months.readline() != '':
    line = months.readline()
    print(len(line))
months.close()
```

```python
#2) Print the number of characters in each months
# CORRECTED
months = open('months.txt', 'r')
line = months.readline() # Priming read
while line != '': # Check if previously read line was empty
    print(len(line))
    line = months.readline() # Read next line
months.close()
```

```python
#3) Store the number of lines in `months.txt` in a new file called `count.txt`
months = open('months.txt', 'w')
data = months.read()
months.close()
size = open('size.txt', 'w')
size.write('lines: '+str(len(data)))
size.close()
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    UnsupportedOperation                      Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_1537/855805968.py in <module>
          1 #3) Store the number of lines in `months.txt` in a new file called `count.txt`
          2 months = open('months.txt', 'w')
    ----> 3 data = months.read()
          4 months.close()
          5 size = open('size.txt', 'w')


    UnsupportedOperation: not readable



```python
#3) Store the number of lines in `months.txt` in a new file called `count.txt`
# CORRECTED
months = open('months.txt', 'r') # Open file for reading
data = months.readlines() # Get a list of lines
months.close()
size = open('size.txt', 'w')
size.write('lines: '+str(len(data)))
size.close()
```

## Exceptions

\#1) *What happens if we run the following program and the user enters `one`?*


```python
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
```

    Enter a number: one



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-32-e5e4786827d2> in <module>
    ----> 1 num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
    

    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'one'


* *What is one way we can avoid having the program crash when a user provides invalid input?* â€” perform input validation
