    "* **Introduction** ⇒ no prior programming experience required\n",
    "* Algorithms and programming are only two aspects of computer science; CS also involves:\n",
    "    * Creativity --- many ways to solve a problem with different trade-offs\n",
    "    * Data --- gathering, organizing, analyzing; processed by programs\n",
    "    * Abstraction --- “hiding” some details of the solution, e.g., how the hardware works\n",

    "    * Networking\n",
