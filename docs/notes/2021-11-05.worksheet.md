# strings and lists
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-11-05_

## Announcements
* Homework 8 due Thursday

# Warm-up
Write a function called `filter_above` that takes a list of integers and a single integer representing a threshold and returns a new list that contains all of the integers in the original list that are above the threshold.


```python
def filter_above(nums, threshold):
    '''
    Return all values in nums that are above threshold
    >>> filter_above([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
    [4, 5]
    >>> filter_above([8, 2, 3, 7, 8], 5)
    [8, 7, 8]
    '''
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
```

ğŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems.

## Strings and lists


```python
# Example with split
paragraph = "Can you jump like a kangaroo? Can you roar like a lion? Can you run like a cheetah?"
words = paragraph.split()
print(words)
sentences = paragraph.split('?')
print(sentences)
```

    ['Can', 'you', 'jump', 'like', 'a', 'kangaroo?', 'Can', 'you', 'roar', 'like', 'a', 'lion?', 'Can', 'you', 'run', 'like', 'a', 'cheetah?']
    ['Can you jump like a kangaroo', ' Can you roar like a lion', ' Can you run like a cheetah', '']


* Use the `join` method to combine a list of strings into a single string separated


```python
# Example with join
new_paragraph = '???'.join(sentences)
print(new_paragraph)
some_words = words[:2] + words[8:10] + words[-2:]
print(some_words)
new_sentence = ' '.join(some_words)
print(new_sentence)
```

    Can you jump like a kangaroo??? Can you roar like a lion??? Can you run like a cheetah???
    ['Can', 'you', 'roar', 'like', 'a', 'cheetah?']
    Can you roar like a cheetah?


* Use the `list` function to covert a string into a list of characters


```python
# Example with conversion to list
phrase = "Have a good day!"
characters = list(phrase)
print(characters)
```

    ['H', 'a', 'v', 'e', ' ', 'a', ' ', 'g', 'o', 'o', 'd', ' ', 'd', 'a', 'y', '!']


### Practice
*What is the output of each of the following programs?*


```python
#1)
year = 'five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes'
hundred = year.split(' hundred ')
print(hundred)
parts = year.split(' ')
new_year = parts[5:7] + parts[3:5] + parts[0:2] + parts[-1:]
print('-'.join(new_year))
```


```python
#2)
units1 = ["daylights", "sunsets", "midnights", "cups of coffee"]
how1 = ""
for unit in units1:
    how1 = how1 + "In " + unit + "? "
print(how1)
units2 = ["inches", "miles", "laughter", "strife"]
how2 = "In " + ", in ".join(units2) + "?"
print(how2)
```

## Programming practice
\#1) *Write a function called `get_words` that takes a sentence and returns a list of the words (in all lowercase) in the sentence. If a word appears more than once, only include it in the list the first time it appears.*


```python
def get_words(sentence):
    '''
    Get a list of words in the sentence
    
    >>> get_words("thirteen has the most")
    ['thirteen', 'has', 'the', 'most']
    >>> get_words("Seven AND eight are tied")
    ['seven', 'and', 'eight', 'are', 'tied']
    >>> get_words("repeat this repeat this")
    ['repeat', 'this']
    '''
   








```

\#2) *Write a function called `get_lengths` that takes a list of words and returns a list with the length of each word in the list.*


```python
def get_lengths(words):
    '''
    Compute the length of each word in the list of words
    
    >>> get_lengths(['thirteen', 'has', 'the', 'most'])
    [8, 3, 3, 4]
    >>> get_lengths(['seven', 'and', 'eight', 'are', 'tied'])
    [5, 3, 5, 3, 4]
    >>> get_lengths(['repeat', 'this'])
    [6, 4] 
    '''
   






```

## Extra practice
\#1): *What is the output of the following programs?*


```python
prefixes = ["How about", "Measure in", "Seasons of"]
for i in range(1, 7, 2):
    prefixes[i:i] = ["love"]
print(prefixes)
lines = []
lines.append(prefixes[:2])
lines = lines + prefixes[2:4]
lines = lines + [prefixes[4:]]
print(lines)
lines[0:1] = lines[0] * 3
lines[-1] = lines[-1] * 2
print(lines)
```

\#2) *Write a function called `get_longest` that takes a sentence and returns the longest word in a sentence. If there is a tie, then return a list of words that are tied for longest.*


```python
def get_longest(sentence):
    '''
    Get the longest word(s) in sentence
    
    >>> get_longest("thirteen has the most")
    'thirteen'
    >>> get_longest("Seven AND eight are tied")
    ['seven', 'eight']
    >>> get_longest("repeat this repeat this")
    'repeat'
    '''
```
