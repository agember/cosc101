## Announcements
* Homework 4 due Thursday

## Warm-up: top-down design
_Design a program that helps a user construct a monthly budget. The program should ask for a userâ€™s annual income, fixed expenses (e.g., rent, groceries, phone), and desired allocation among variable expenses (e.g., clothing, travel). Assume 20% of a userâ€™s annual income is put into savings. **Your design should consist of function definitions and docstrings; also, add a comment in a function's body if it should call one of the other functions. Do not write the function bodies.**_

```






































```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up question; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## doctests

_Write 4 good doctests for each of the following functions:_


```python
#1)
def funcB(v):
    """Determines if a number is even"""
    return (v % 2) == 0
```

```










```


```python
#2)
def funcC(n):
    """Rounds a number to the nearest multiple of ten"""
    p = n % 10
    if p <= 5:
        return n - p
    else:
        return n + (10 - p)
```

```











```


```python
#3)
def count_characters(paragraph):
    """Counts the number of characters in a paragraph"""
    return len(paragraph)
```

```












```


```python
#4)
def count_words(paragraph):
    """Counts the number of words in a paragraph"""
    words = 0
    for char in paragraph:
        if char == ' ':
            words = words + 1
    words = words + 1 # Include last word, which won't have a space afterwards
    return words
```

```












```


```python
#5)
def count_sentences(paragraph):
    """Counts the number of sentences in a paragraph"""
    sentences = 0
    for char in paragraph:
        if char == '.':
            sentences = sentences + 1
    return sentences
```

```











```

## Extra practice

_Implement the functions in the program you designed in the warm-up._
