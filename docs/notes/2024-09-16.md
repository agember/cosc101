# Functions: docstrings; (de)composition
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-09-16_

## Announcements
* Homework 2 due Thursday at 11:59pm

## Docstrings

* Special category of comment that summarizes what a function does
* A triple-double-quoted (`"""`) string placed directly after the function header
* Example:


```python
def convert_to_meters(feet: int, inches: int) -> float:
    """
    Converts a length in feet and inches to meters

    Parameters:
        feet: feet component of length
        inches: inches component of length
    Returns:
        length in meters
    """
    feet = feet + inches / 12
    return feet * 0.3058
```

* A good docstring should:
    * Include a useful summary
        * Bad example: `Performs conversion`
    * Include a concise summary â€” a short sentence summarizing the behavior
        * Bad example: `This function converts the length measurement to feet and multiplies the feet by 0.3058 to get the length in meters.`
    * Not describe the lines of code in the function body
        * Bad example: `Adds feet to inches divided by 12 and multiplies by 0.3058`
    * Include all parameters with a short description of each
        * Bad example: `Parameters: feet, inches`
        * Bad example: `feet: a length measured in the United States customary measurement feet, in which 12 inches are in one foot`
        * Good parameter names are also important
            * Bad example: `f` and `i`
            * Bad example: `length_in_feet` and `length_in_inches`
    * Include a short description of what the function returns
         * Bad example: `The result of converting inches to feet and feet to meters`

_Write a good docstring for each of the following functions_


```python
import math
def funcA(radius: float) -> float:
    return math.pi * (radius ** 2)
```


```python
"""
Computes the area of a circle

Parameters:
    radius: circle's radius
Returns:
    area of the circle
"""
```

```







```


```python
def funcB(hours: int, minutes: int, seconds: int) -> int:
    minutes = minutes + (hours * 60)
    seconds = seconds + (minutes * 60)
    return seconds
```


```python
"""
Converts a time in hours, minutes, and seconds to seconds

Parameters:
    hours: hours component of time
    minutes: minutes component of time
    seconds: seconds component of time
Returns:
    the time in seconds
"""
```

```







```

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the docstrings; if you have extra time **skip** to the extra practice.

## Decomposition and composition

* Already discussed decomposition as a motivation for functions â€“ remember the cupcake recipe with ingredients and directions?
* Already been using composition by...
    * Calling built-in functions (e.g., `print`) from functions we wrote
    * Writing a `main` function that calls functions we wrote

_A person's taxable income is their annual income minus eligible deductions (e.g., contributions to charity and a traditional individual retirement account (IRA)). Write a `main` function that uses built-in funtions and the functions below to compute a person's taxable income._


```python
def compute_deductions() -> float:
    """
    Calculate total deduction

    Return:
        user's total deducation
    """
    monthly = float(input("How much did you contribute to charity each month? $"))
    charity = monthly * 12
    monthly = float(input("How much did you contribute to a tradtional IRA each month? $"))
    ira = monthly * 12
    total = charity + ira
    return total

def taxable(income: float, deductions: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate taxable income

    Parameters:
        income: annual income
        deductions: total deductions
    Return:
        taxable income
    """
    taxable = income - deductions
    return taxable
```


```python
def main():
    income = float(input("How much did you earn last year? $"))
    deductions = compute_deductions()
    net = taxable(income, deductions)
    print("Your taxable income is $"+str(net))

main()
```

    How much did you earn last year? $ 50000
    How much did you contribute to charity each month?  50
    How much did you contribute to a traditional IRA each month?  100


    Your taxable income is $48200.0


```










```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

_Decompose the task of computing total deductions into subproblems and look for patterns. Write a new function based on the identified subproblems and patterns, and re-write the `compute_deductions` function to use your new function. Your re-written `compute_deductions` function should not require any changes to the `main` function your wrote above._


```python
def contribute(thing: str) -> float:
    """
    Determine user's annual contributions to something

    Parameters:
        item: item to which the user contributed
    Return:
        amount user contributed in a year
    """
    monthly = float(input("How much did you contribute to "+thing+" each month? $"))
    annually = monthly * 12
    return annually
    
def compute_deductions() -> float:
    """
    Calculate total deduction based on contributions

    Return:
        user's total deducation
    """
    charity = contribute("charity")
    ira = contribute("a traditional IRA")
    total = charity + ira
    return total
```

    How much did you earn last year?  50000
    How much did you contribute to charity each month?  50
    How much did you contribute to a traditional IRA each month?  100


    Your taxable income is $48200.0


```

























```

## Extra practice

_What is the output of this program? (Remember to draw a reference diagram!)_


```python
def alpha(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

def beta(x: int) -> int:
    z = alpha(x, 3)
    return z**2

def main() -> None:
    i = 4
    print(beta(i))

main()
```

    49


```


```

_What is the output of this program? (Remember to draw a reference diagram!)_


```python
def func1(x, y):
    print(x, y)
    return x + y

def func2(x, y):
    z = x
    x = y
    y = z
    print(x, y)

def main():
    x = "A"
    y = "B"
    result1 = func1(x, y)
    print(result1)
    result2 = func2(x, y)
    print(x, y, result2)

main()
```

    A B
    AB
    B A
    A B None


```





```

_Add type annotations to the functions in the program above._

_Label each of the following in the program below:_
1. Function bodies
2. Function calls
3. Function definitions
4. Arguments
5. Parameters
6. Return types


```python
def update(x: int) -> int:
    
    x = x * 2
    
    return x * 2

def main() -> None:
    
    a = 5
    
    b = update(a)
    
    print(a, b)

main()
```

    5 20



```python
def update(x: int) -> int: # Function definition; x is a parameter; None is the return type
    x = x * 2       # Function body
    return x * 2    # Function body

def main() -> None: # Function definition; None is the return type
    a = 5           # Function body
    b = update(a)   # Function body; function call; a is an argument
    print(a, b)     # Function body; function call; a and b are arguments

main() # Function call
```
