```
<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## Code tracing
_What is the output of the following programs?_


```python
#1)
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + 3
a = b
b = b + 1
print(a, b, c)
```

```





```


```python
#2)
a = 'hi'
b = 'bye'
c = a + '!' + b + '!'
if (a == 'hello'):
    b = 'goodbye'
else:
    b = 'adios'
c = c * 2
print(a, b, c)
```

```





```


```python
#3)
a = ''
b = str(8)
for c in range(5):
    a = a + str(c)
for c in range(6, 0, -2):
    b = b + str(c)
print(a,b,c)
```

```





```
<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

## More code tracing
_What is the output of the following program for each of the inputs below?_


```python
a = int(input('A='))
b = float(input('B='))
c = input('C=')
if (a > 10):
    if (b > 10 and a <= 15):
        print('1')
    else:
        print('2')
elif (a < 5):
    if (c == 'cat'):
        print('3')
else:
    if (c == 'dog' or b > 10):
        print ('4')
    else:
        print('5')
```

\#1) `11`, `9`, `cat`

```





```

\#2) `10`, `11`, `dog`

```





```

\#3) `4`, `11`, `dog`

```





```

\#4) `7`, `15`, `cat`

```





```
<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

_What is the output of the following program for each of the inputs below?_


```python
a = int(input('A='))
b = int(input('B='))
c = 0
for i in range(a, b):
    if (i % 2 == 0):
        c += 1
print(c)

```

\#5) `0`, `7`

```





```

\#6) `4`, `8`

```





```

\#7) `-3`, `3`

```





```

## Writing code

\#1) _Write a program that asks for a month and day and prints "Happy Fall!‚Äù if the user entered September 22 or ‚ÄúHappy Halloween!‚Äù if the user entered October 31._

```C


















```

\#2) _Write a program that computes how much an employee earns in a week. The program should ask for the employee‚Äôs hourly pay rate and the number of hours they worked each day of the week._

```C















```

\#3) _Write a program that asks for a pizza‚Äôs diameter (in centimeters) and number of slices and computes the area of each slice. (Hint: The area of a circle is ùúãr¬≤.)_

```C
















```

\#4) _Write a program that draws the number 3 as it would appear on a digital clock._
