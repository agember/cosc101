## Warm-up
_Write a program that asks for yesterday’s and today’s high temperatures and outputs `Today is warmer`, `Today is colder`, or `Today is the same`._


```python
yesterday = float(input("Yesterday's high temperature: "))
today = float(input("Today's high temperature: "))
if today > yesterday:
    print("Today is warmer")
elif today < yesterday:
    print("Today is colder")
else:
    print("Today is the same")
```

## Good programming practices
* Understand the target semantics — i.e., what output should the program produce for various inputs?
* Decompose the solution and implement one step at a time
    * Run your program after you implement each step
    * Worst programming practice: write a full solution to a problem first, then run it
* Test on different inputs
    * Include boundary cases — inputs that are at the extremes of the acceptable (or expected) range

### Example
_Write a program that asks for a user’s first and last name and outputs which is the longest._
* Decompose solution and implement one step:
    * Ask user for first and last name
        ```Python
        first = input("Your first name: ")
        last = input("Your last name: ")
        ```
    * Compute the lengths
    * Determine which is longer
* Test on different inputs:
    * Include temporary print statement
        ```Python
        print(first, last)
        ```
    * 1st test case: `Katherine`, `Johnson`
    * 2nd test case: `Mary`, `Jackson`
    * 3rd test case: `Dorothy`, `Vaughan` (boundary)
* Implement next step and retest
    ```Python
    first_len = len(first)
    last_len = len(last)
    print(first_len, last_len)
    ```
* Implement next step and retest
    ```Python
    if (first_len < last_len):
      print("Your first name is longer")
    else:
      print("Your last name is longer")
    ```
* Debugging strategies
    * Add print statements
    * Use CodeLens (also called Visualize) — you will get practice with this in lab

## Debugging practice
_A scientist tried to write a program that asks for a temperature in degrees fahrenheit and converts the temperature to degrees celsius and degrees kelvin._


```python
f = input("Temperature in degrees fahrenheit:")
c = f - 32 * (9 / 5
print("Temperature in degrees celsius:"+c)
k = c + 273.15
print("Temperature in degrees kelvin:+k")
```

1. Syntax error on line 3
    1. Comment out line 3 ⇒ syntax error on line 4; comment out line 4 ⇒ syntax error on line 5; suggests syntax error is before line 3
    2. Uncomment lines 3 and 4; comment out line 2 ⇒ syntax error goes away
    3. Add missing parenthesis
2. Type error on line 2
    1. Add `print(f, type(f))` between lines 1 and 2 ⇒ f is a string
    2. Cannot subtract string and integer
    3. Add `f = int(f)` between lines 2 and 3
3. Type error on line 3
    1. Add `print(c, type(c))` between lines 2 and 3 ⇒ c is a float
    2. Cannot add string and float
    3. Add `c = str(c)` between lines 2 and 3
4. Type error on line 4
    1. Add 1print(c, type(c))1 between lines 3 and 4 ⇒ c is a str
    2. We just added a conversion to fix the previous error, which caused a new problem
    3. Alternative fix for previous error: change line 3 to `print("Temperature in degrees celsius:"+str(c))`
5. Semantic error on line 5
    1. Update line 5 to `print("Temperature in degrees kelvin:"+k)`
6. Semantic error on line 3
    1. Update line 2 to `c = (f - 32) * (9 / 5)`


## Function calls
* _What is a function?_ — a set of statements that are referred to by a given name
    * E.g., `print`, `input`, `int`, `float`, `str`
* _What is a function call?_ — a request to execute the statements within the named function
    * E.g., `print("message")`, `int("13")`
* _How is a function called?_ — function name, left parenthesis `(`, comma-separated list of parameters (if required), right parenthesis `)`
    * E.g., `print("one", "two", "three")`

## Modules

* _What is a module?_ — a file containing functions, variables, and classes (i.e., new types of objects) that are intended for use in other Python programs
* _What are some examples of modules you might use?_ — `math`, `random`, `turtles`
* _What do you need to include in your program if you want to use a module?_ — an `import` statement
* _How do you use something contained in an imported module?_ — using the module name, dot (`.`), and the name of the thing you want to use, e.g., `math.pi`

### Practice
 [TSA pseudo-randomizer YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_KmFJ2gGzw)

\#1) _Write your own TSA pseudo-randomizer app. Hint: Use the `randint` function from the `random` module; `randint` requires two parameters—a minimum and maximum integer—and generates a random integer that is greater than or equal to the minimum and less than or equal to the maximum._


```python
import random
# Choose direction
direction = random.randint(0,1)
# Output choice
if direction == 0:
    print("<<-- Left")
else:
    print("Right -->>")
```

\#2) _Write a program that asks for the number of sides on a die and “rolls” the die._


```python
import random
# Get number of sides
sides = int(input("How many sides?"))
# Roll
roll = random.randint(1, sides)
print("You rolled", roll)
```

## Turtle graphics

* Useful for illustrating computational thinking
* _What do you need to do before you can draw with a turtle?_
    * Import the module — `import turtle`
    * Create a graphics window — `window = turtle.Screen()`
    * Create a `Turtle` object — `bowser = turtle.Turtle()`
* Useful Turtle functions
    * `forward(steps)` — move forward by the specified number of steps
    * `left(degrees)` — turn to the left by the specified number of degrees
    * `right(degrees)` — turn to the right by the specified number of degrees
    * `up()` — stop drawing
    * `down()` — resume drawing
    
### Practice

\#1) _Write a program that draws the number 2 (like on a digital clock)._


```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
bowser = turtle.Turtle() # Bowser is a fictional character in Nintendo's Mario series

bowser.forward(50)
bowser.right(90)
bowser.forward(50)
bowser.right(90)
bowser.forward(50)
bowser.left(90)
bowser.forward(50)
bowser.left(90)
bowser.forward(50)

window.exitonclick()
```

\#2) _Write a program that draws a simple house._

![House](https://static.thenounproject.com/png/687060-200.png)


```python
import math
import turtle

window = turtle.Screen()
zaha = turtle.Turtle()

# Left wall
zaha.right(90)
zaha.forward(100)

# Base and door
zaha.left(90)
zaha.forward(35)
zaha.left(90)
zaha.forward(50)
zaha.right(90)
zaha.forward(30)
zaha.right(90)
zaha.forward(50)
zaha.left(90)
zaha.forward(35)

# Right wall
zaha.left(90)
zaha.forward(100)

# Roof
zaha.left(45)
roof_side = int(math.sqrt(50 ** 2 + 50 ** 2))
zaha.forward(roof_side)
zaha.left(90)
zaha.forward(roof_side)

window.exitonclick()
```

## Extra practice
\#1) _Write a program that asks for the length of the sides of a right triangle and computes the length of the hypotenuse. Hint: You’ll need to use the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) and the `sqrt` function in the `math` module._


```python
import math
side_a = int(input("Length of side A? "))
side_b = int(input("Length of side B? "))
side_c = math.sqrt(side_a ** 2 + side_b ** 2)
print("Length of the hypotenuse:", side_c)
```

    Length of side A?  3
    Length of side B?  4


    Length of the hypotenuse: 5.0


\#2) _Write a program that asks for the length of the hpotenuse and one side of a right triangle and computes the angle opposite the side in radians. Hint: You’ll need to use the law of sines (a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C) and the `sin` and `asin` functions (which work with radians, not degrees) and the `pi` constant in the `math` module._


```python
import math
hypotenuse = int(input("Length of hypotenuse? "))
side = int(input("Length of side? "))
right_angle = math.pi / 2
angle = side *  math.sin(right_angle) / hypotenuse
angle = math.asin(angle)
print(angle)
```

    Length of hypotenuse?  5
    Length of side?  3


    0.6435011087932844


\#3) _Write a program that asks for the length of the sides of a right triangle and draws the corresponding triangle. Hint: You’ll need to reuse some of your code from the above programs, along with the `degrees` function in the `math` module to convert radians to degrees._


```python
import math
import turtle

# Length of sides
side_a = int(input("Length of side A? "))
side_b = int(input("Length of side B? "))
side_c = int(math.sqrt(side_a ** 2 + side_b ** 2))

# Angles
angle_c = math.pi / 2
angle_a = side_a * math.sin(angle_c) / side_c
angle_a = math.asin(angle_a)

# Draw triangle
window = turtle.Screen()
speedy = turtle.Turtle()
speedy.forward(side_a)
speedy.left(math.degrees(angle_c))
speedy.forward(side_b)
speedy.left(180 - math.degrees(angle_a))
speedy.forward(side_c)
window.exitonclick()
```

\#4) _Write a program that draws the Big Dipper constellation_

![Big Dipper constellation](https://static.thenounproject.com/png/5239-200.png)


```python
import turtle

window = turtle.Screen()
ghido = turtle.Turtle()

ghido.left(10)
ghido.forward(50)
ghido.right(35)
ghido.forward(50)
ghido.right(55)
ghido.forward(50)
ghido.left(75)
ghido.forward(50)
ghido.left(75)
ghido.forward(50)
ghido.left(105)
ghido.forward(75)

window.exitonclick()
```
