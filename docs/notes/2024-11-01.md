# Sequences: references
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-11-01_

## Announcements
* Exam 2 retakes Friday, Nov 8 during class

## Warm-up

*Assume a list of strings has been assigned to the variable `words`. Write a snippet of code that updates each item in the list to contain the first letter in each string. For example: `["Computer", "Science"]` would be updated to `["C", "S"]`*


```python
words = ["Computer", "Science"]
for index in range(len(words)):
    words[index] = words[index][0]
print(words)
```

    ['C', 'S']

## References

* Recall: a list is a sequential collection of values
    * Analogy: a folder holds a sequential collection of papers
    * `[2, 4, 6]`
* When you assign a list to a variable, the variable becomes a name for the collection
    * Analogy: label folder


```python
listA = [2, 4, 6]
print(listA)
```

    [2, 4, 6]


* When you add and remove items, you are changing what is in the collection, but the name still refers to the same collection
    * Analogy: add and remove papers from a folder, but you are not relabeling the folder


```python
listA[1] = 40
print("A", listA)
```

    A [2, 40, 6]


* Creating another list creates another sequential collection of values
    * Analogy: get a new folder


```python
listB = []
print("A", listA, "B", listB)
```

    A [2, 40, 6] B []


* Even if you put the same values in each list, the collections are still different
    * Analogy: put the same papers in each folder, but each folder is still separate


```python
listB.append(2)
listB.append(40)
listB.append(6)
print("A", listA, "B", listB)
```

    A [2, 40, 6] B [2, 40, 6]


* However, if you assign the name of a list to a new name, then you create an alias
    * Analogy: add another label to the list


```python
listC = listA
print("A", listA, "C", listC)
```

    A [2, 40, 6] C [2, 40, 6]


* Regardless which name you use, you are referring to the same list; hence, changes made using one name will also be reflected if you use the other name to refer to the list
    * Analogy: add and remove papers from the same folder with multiple labels


```python
listC[0] = 20
print("A", listA, "C", listC)
listA[2] = 60
print("A", listA, "C", listC)
```

    A [20, 40, 6] C [20, 40, 6]
    A [20, 40, 60] C [20, 40, 60]


* You can check if two different names refer to the same list using the `is` operator
* You can check if two lists (which may or may not be the same list) contain the same items using the `==` opearator


```python
listD = [20, 40, 60]
print("A", listA, "C", listC, "D", listD)
print("A is C?", listA is listC, "A is D?", listA is listD)
print("A == C?", listA == listC, "A == D?", listA == listD)
```

    A [20, 40, 60] C [20, 40, 60] D [20, 40, 60]
    A is C? True A is D? False
    A == C? True A == D? True


* To avoid aliasing, you must create a clone of (part of) the list using the slice operator
    * Analogy: get a new folder with a copy of all of the items in the original folder


```python
listE = listA[:]
print("A", listA, "E", listE)
listE[0] = 10
print("A", listA, "E", listE)
listA[2] = 70
print("A", listA, "E", listE)
```

* Parameters
    * Recall: at the start of the function, all actual parameters and are assigned to the formal parameters
    * Consequently, list name is assigned another name â†’ formal parameter is an alias
    * Consequence: changing the list using the formal parameter will change the same list as changing the list using the actual parameter


```python
def funcX(listR):
    print("R", listR)
    listR[0] = 2
    print("R", listR)

def main() -> None:
    listQ = [1, 3, 5]
    print("Q", listQ)
    funcX(listQ)
    print("Q", listQ)

main()
```

    Q [1, 3, 5]
    R [1, 3, 5]
    R [2, 3, 5]
    Q [2, 3, 5]

_What is the output of the following program?_


```python
def main() -> None:
    intro = [101, 102]
    courses = intro
    print(courses is intro)
    print(courses == intro)
    courses = [intro[0], intro[1]]
    print(courses is intro)
    print(courses == intro)

    schedule = schedule + courses

_Write a function called `remove_strings` that takes a list of values and returns a new list with all strings removed. For example, `remove_strings(["Courses", "COSC", 101, "COSC", 208, 11.01])` should return the list `[101, 208, 11.01]`. As another example, `remove_strings(["ABC", "123"])` should return an empty list `[]`._


```python
def remove_strings(values: list) -> list:
    """
    >>> remove_strings(["Courses", "COSC", 101, "COSC", 208, 11.01])
    [101, 208, 11.01]
    >>> remove_strings(["ABC", "123"])
    []
    """
    result = []
    for value in values:
        if (type(value) != str):
            result.append(value)
    return result

import doctest
doctest.testmod()
```

_Write a function called `filter` that takes a string of numbers of separated by spaces and an integer cut-off and returns a list containing all numbers in the string that are less than the provided cut-off. For example, `filter("1 33 46 18 19", 25)` should return the list `[1, 18, 19]`. As another example, `filter("316 208 212 101 214", 13)` should return an empty list `[]`._


```python
def filter(numbers: str, cutoff: int) -> list:
    """
    >>> filter("1 33 46 18 19", 25)
    [1, 18, 19]
    >>> filter("316 208 212 101 214", 13)
    []
    """
    all_nums = numbers.split()
    result_nums = []
    for num in all_nums:
        num = int(num)
        if num < cutoff:
            result_nums.append(num)
    return result_nums

import doctest

_Write a function called `get_amounts` that repeatedly asks the user how much they purchased until they enter 0 and returns a list containing each of the purchase amounts (excluding 0). For example:_

Prompts and user input:
```
How much was purchase 1? 100
How much was purchase 2? 50
How much was purchase 3? 200
How much was purchase 4? 0
```
Return value:
```
[100, 50, 200]
```


```python
def get_amounts() -> list:
    amounts = []
    count = 1
    amount = int(input("How much was purchase 1? "))
    while (amount > 0):
        amounts.append(amount)
        amount = int(input("How much was purchase " + str(len(amounts) + 1) + "? "))
    return amounts

get_amounts()
```

    How much was purchase 1?  100
    How much was purchase 2?  50
    How much was purchase 3?  200
    How much was purchase 4?  0





    [100, 50, 200]
