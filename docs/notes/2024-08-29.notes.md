## Getting to know Aaron
* Please call me...Aaron _or_ Professor Aaron
* My pronouns are...he/him
* Two things I like to do for fun are...building with Legos, and doing house projects.
* I am teaching this course because...programming is fun, and I enjoy the “aha” moments that occur when students are learning to program.
* My prior experience with computer science is...my first CS course junior year of high school (22 years ago), followed by a bachelor of science, masters of science, and PhD in computer science.
* Besides my courses, I expect to spend significant time each week...handling administrative matters for the department in my role as department chair.

## What is "Introduction to Computing I"?
* "**Computer science** is the study of algorithmic processes and the machines that carry out these processes." – Colgate Catalog
* "An **algorithm** is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration." – Foundations of Python Programming
* "**Programming** is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in a notation (a program) that can be followed by a computer."  – Foundations of Python Programming
* **Introduction** ⇒ no prior programming experience required
* Algorithms and programming are only two aspects of computer science; CS also involves:
    * Creativity – many ways to solve a problem with different trade-offs
    * Data – gathering, organizing, analyzing; processed by programs
    * Abstraction – “hiding” some details of the solution, e.g., how the hardware works
* Areas of computer science
    * Networking
    * Artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing
    * Programming languages
    * Architecture – design of computing hardware (e.g., CPU)
    * Security
    * Human-computer interaction (HCI)
    * Graphics
    * And more...
* Computer science intersects with lots of other disciplines, such as:
    * Biology – searching for patterns in genomic data
    * History – analyzing ancient texts
    * Geology – earthquake modeling
    * Political science – predicting election outcomes
    * Astronomy – analyzing telescope images
    * Finance – high-frequency trading

## Syllabus highlights
* Important dates
* Before each class, read and complete activites in sections listed on Runestone website 
    * For Monday: Read and complet activities in sections 1.1-1.10, 2.1-2.3
* Class meetings: warm-up problems, presenting concepts, working through examples, problem solving practice individually and in small groups 
    * Be an **active participant**: listen attentively, ask questions, solve problems, and avoid distractions on your phone/ tablet/laptop
    * Be a **respectful participant**: raise your hand, respect others’ identities and contributions, leave space for others to speak, and give credit to others for their ideas
* Labs start next week
* Academic integrity and collaboration
    * You may discuss and collaborate with others or consult forums and generative AI when working on pre-class preparation, materials from class, studying for exams
    * You may **NOT** discuss or colloborate with others or use forums or generative AI on homeworks or exams
    * I will be reasonably flexible on deadlines
    * I want you to succeed, and I will do everything I can to help you!
* Seek help and support!
    * Office hours are an opportunity to ask questions about material from the textbook, material from class, homeworks, exams, your performance in the class, or non-class related matters
