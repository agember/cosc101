_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-10-21_

## Announcements
* Homework 6
    * Parts 1 and 2 with an assigned partner due Tuesday @ 11:59pm
    * Part 3 individually due Friday @ 11:59pm

## doctests

* Method for automatically checks whether a function returns the correct result
    * Must be written by a person who knows what a function should do
    * Multiple unit tests should be written for a function
* Include function call and expected output within docstring
* At top of file `import doctest`; at bottom of file call `doctest.testmod()`
* Example:


```python
import doctest

def funcA(w: int, x: int) -> int:
    """
    Computes the minimum
    Parameters
    * w: first number
    * x: second number
    Returns
    The minimum of the two numbers
    
    >>> funcA(1, 2)
    1
    >>> funcA(2, 1)
    1
    >>> funcA(2, 2)
    2
    """
    if (w < x):
        return w
    else:
        return x

doctest.testmod()
```




    TestResults(failed=0, attempted=3)



* Cannot (easily) use doctests to test functions that require input
    * Ask for input only in main (or as few functions as possible)

```














```

_Write 4 good doctests for each of the following functions:_


```python
def round10(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Rounds a number to the nearest multiple of ten
    Parameter:
    * n: number to round
    Returns:
    number rounded to the nearest multiple of ten
    """
    p = n % 10
    if p <= 5:
        return n - p
    else:
        return n + (10 - p)
```


```python
def round10(n):
    """
    Rounds a number to the nearest multiple of ten
    Parameter:
    * n: number to round
    Returns:
    number rounded to the nearest multiple of ten
    
    >>> funcC(13)
    10
    >>> funcC(27)
    30
    >>> funcC(30)
    30
    >>> funcC(45)
    40
    """
    p = n % 10
    if p <= 5:
        return n - p
    else:
        return n + (10 - p)
```

```









```


```python
def count_words(paragraph: str) -> str:
    """
    Counts the number of words in a paragraph
    Parameter
    * paragraph: paragraph where each word is separated by a space
    Return
    the number of words (i.e., spaces) in a paragraph
    """
    words = 0
    for char in paragraph:
        if char == ' ':
            words = words + 1
    words = words + 1 # Include last word, which won't have a space afterwards
    return words
```


```python
def count_words(paragraph):
    """
    Counts the number of words in a paragraph
    Parameter
    * paragraph: paragraph where each word is separated by a space
    Return
    the number of words (i.e., spaces) in a paragraph
    
    >>> count_words("Once upon a time, there lived a COSC 101 student. They loved programming.")
    13
    >>> count_words("They loved programming.")
    3
    >>> count_words("Hooray.")
    1
    >>> count_words(""Once upon a time, there lived a COSC 101 student.")
    10
    """
    words = 0
    for char in paragraph:
        if char == ' ':
            words = words + 1
    words = words + 1 # Include last word, which won't have a space afterwards
    return words
```

```










```

## Slicing

* Used to select a contiguous subset of elements in a sequence (e.g., characters in a string or items in a list
* Put starting and ending indices in square brackets separated by a colon
    * Includes element at starting index, but excludes element at ending index—similar to sequence generated by `range` going to `STOP-1`


```python
myString = "Colgate 13"
print(myString[0:7])
print(myString[8:10])
```

    Colgate
    13


* _What happens if you exclude the starting index?_ —slice starts at the beginning of the string


```python
print(myString[:3])
```

    Col


* _What happens if you exclude the ending index?_ —slice stops at the end of the string


```python
print(myString[8:])
```

    13


```

## String methods

* String operators
    * `+` — concetantes two strings
    * `*` — repeats a string
    * `in` — true if one string exists within another string, otherwise false
    * `not in` — true if one string does not exist within another string, otherwise false
* Built-in functions
    * `len` — returns the length of a string
* String methods are functions that are applied to a specific string


```python
title = 'Still I rise'
print(title.upper())
```

    STILL I RISE


* Common string methods
    * `upper`, `lower` — converts all characters to upper or lower case
    * `strip` – removes leading and trailing whitespace (space, tab, newline)
    * `replace` — replace all occurrences of one substring with another
    * `index` — get index where first occurence of substring starts
    * `count` – count number of time substring occurs in string
    * `split` – returns a list of substrings based on the given delimeter
    * `join` – combines a list of substrings with the given delimeter


```python
parts = ["editor", "in", "chief"]
compound = '-'.join(parts)
print(compound)
string = "chocolate,peppermint,pineapple,coconut"
flavors = string.split(",")
print(flavors)
```

    editor-in-chief
    ['chocolate', 'peppermint', 'pineapple', 'coconut']


* `replace`, `index`, and `count` also work with lists


```python
words = ["popcorn", "popping", "goes", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
print(words.count("pop"))
print(words[0].count("pop"))
print(words.index("goes"))
```

    3
    1
    2


*What is the output of each of the following programs?*


```python
def main() -> None:
    year = 'five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes'
    hundred = year.split(' hundred ')
    print(hundred)
    parts = year.split(' ')
    print('-'.join(parts[2:5]))
main()
```

    ['five', 'twenty five thousand six', 'minutes']
    twenty-five-thousand


<p style="height:5em;"></p>


```python
def main() -> None:
    units1 = ["daylights", "sunsets", "midnights", "cups of coffee"]
    how1 = ""
    for unit in units1:
        how1 = how1 + "In " + unit + "? "
    print(how1)
    units2 = ["inches", "miles", "laughter", "strife"]
    how2 = "In " + ", in ".join(units2) + "?"
    print(how2)
main()
```

    In daylights? In sunsets? In midnights? In cups of coffee? 
    In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife?
