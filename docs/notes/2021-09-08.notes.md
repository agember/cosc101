_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-09-08_

## Announcements
* Homework 1 due tomorrow at 5pm

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Nested conditionals
* Chained conditionals
* Good programming practices

## Warm-up
\#1) _Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
day = input("Today is ")
if (day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday"):
    print("It is the weekend")
else:
    print("It is a weekday")
if (day == "Wednesday"):
    print("Halfway to the weekend")
print("Happy " + day + "!")
```

\#2) _What will the program output if a user enters `Saturday`?_

```
Today is Saturday
It is the weekend
Happy Saturday!
```

\#3) _What will the program output if a user enters `Monday`?_

```
Today is Monday
It is a weekday
Happy Monday!
```

\#4) _What will the program output if a user enters `Wednesday`?_

```
Today is Wednesday
It is a weekday
Happy Wednesday!
Halfway to the weekend
```

## Nested conditionals

The statements that are executed when a condition is true (or false) may include another if statement

### Example


```python
x = int(input("x="))
y = int(input("y="))
if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        print("x is positive, y is positive")
    else:
        print("x is positive, y is negative")
else:
    print("x is not positive")
print(x, "+", y, "=", x+y)
```

### Practice
\#1) _Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
a = int(input("a="))
if a >= 50:
    print("Large")
else:
    if (a < 10):
        print ("Small")
    else:
        print("Medium")
```

\#2) _What will the program output if a user enters `5`?_

`Small`

\#3) _What will the program output if a user enters `10`?_

`Medium`

\#4) _What will the program output if a user enters `55`?_

`Large`

\#5) _Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
i = int(input("i="))
j = int(input("j="))
if i > 5:
    if j > 15:
        print("A")
else:
    if j > 15:
        print("B")
if i > 10:
    print("C")
```

\#6) _What will the program output if a user enters `5` and `20`?_

`B`

\#7) _What will the program output if a user enters `10` and `40`?_

`A`

\#8) _What will the program output if a user enters `20` and `5`?_

`C`

## Chained conditionals

Multiple conditions that are checked in sequence

### Example


```python
day = int(input("Day? "))
if day <= 7:
    print("1st week")
elif day > 7 and day <= 14:
    print("2nd week")
else:
    print("Beyond")
print("End")
```

### Practice
_Re-write each program to use chained conditionals instead of nested conditionals_


```python
#1)
a = int(input("a="))
if a >= 50:
    print("Large")
else:
    if (a < 10):
        print ("Small")
    else:
        print("Medium")
```


```python
a = int(input("a="))
if a >= 50:
    print("Large")
elif (a < 10):
    print ("Small")
else:
    print("Medium")
```


```python
#2)
i = int(input("i="))
j = int(input("j="))
if i > 5:
    if j > 15:
        print("A")
else:
    if j > 15:
        print("B")
if i > 10:
    print("C")
```


```python
i = int(input("i="))
j = int(input("j="))
if i > 5 and j > 15:
    print("A")
elif j > 15:
    print("B")
if i > 10:
    print("C")
```

## Good programming practices
* Understand the target semantics — i.e., what output should the program produce for various inputs?
* Decompose the solution and implement one step at a time
    * Run your program after you implement each step
    * Worst programming practice: write a full solution to a problem first, then run it
* Test on different inputs
    * Include boundary cases — inputs that are at the extremes of the acceptable (or expected) range

### Example
_Write a program that asks for a user’s first and last name and outputs which is the longest._
* Decompose solution and implement one step:
    * Ask user for first and last name
        ```Python
        first = input("Your first name: ")
        last = input("Your last name: ")
        ```
    * Compute the lengths
    * Determine which is longer
* Test on different inputs:
    * Include temporary print statement
        ```Python
        print(first, last)
        ```
    * 1st test case: `Katherine`, `Johnson`
    * 2nd test case: `Mary`, `Jackson`
    * 3rd test case: `Dorothy`, `Vaughan` (boundary)
* Implement next step and retest
    ```Python
    first_len = len(first)
    last_len = len(last)
    print(first_len, last_len)
    ```
* Implement next step and retest
    ```Python
    if (first_len < last_len):
      print("Your first name is longer")
    else:
      print("Your last name is longer")
    ```
* Debugging strategies
    * Add print statements
    * Use CodeLens (also called Visualize) — you will get practice with this in lab

## Extra practice

### Programming with conditionals
\#1) _Write a program that asks for a person's age and outputs whether they are a minor (under 18), an adult (18 or older), and/or a teenager (age 13 through 19)._


```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
if (age < 18):
    print("You are a minor")
else:
    print("You are an adult")
if (age >= 13 and age <= 19):
    print("You are a teenager")
```

    How old are you?  15


    You are a minor
    You are a teenager


\#2) _Write a program that asks for the number of hours an employee works each week and outputs whether they work full-time (40 or more hours), half-time (exactly 20 hours) or part-time (less than 40 hours, but not exactly 20 hours)._


```python
hours = int(input("How many hours do you work each week? "))
if (hours == 20):
    print("You work half-time")
elif (hours >= 40):
    print("You work full-time")
else:
    print("You work part-time")
```

    How many hours do you work each week?  35


    You work part-time


### Tracing conditionals
_For each of the following programs, which code blocks will be executed when the listed conditions are true?_

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
if condition 2:
    code block B
elif condition 3:
    code block C
else:
    code block D
```

\#1) _When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

A, B

\#2) _When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

B

\#3) _When only condition 1 is True_

A

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
    if condition 2:
        code block B
    elif condition 3:
        code block C
else:
    code block D
```

\#4) _When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

A, B

\#5) _When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

D

\#6) _When only condition 1 is True_

A

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
    if condition 2:
        code block B
    else:
        code block C
if condition 3:
    code block D
```

\#7) _When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

A, B

\#8) _When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

D

\#9) _When only condition 1 is True_

A, C
