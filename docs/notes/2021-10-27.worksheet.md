# string methods; string formatting
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-10-27_

## Announcements
* Homework 6 due tomorrow at 5pm

## Warm-up
_Write a function called pig_latin that takes a single word and translates the word to pig latin by moving the first letter to the end of the word and adding “ay” to the end. For example:_
* `pig_latin('pig')` returns `'igpay'`
* `pig_latin('latin')` returns `'atinlay'`
