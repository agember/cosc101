# string methods; string formatting
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-10-27_

## Announcements
* Homework 6 due tomorrow at 5pm

## Warm-up
_Write a function called pig_latin that takes a single word (as a string) as an argument and translates the word to pig latin. To translate a word to pig latin, move the first letter to the end of the word and add “ay” to the end. For example:_
* `pig_latin('pig')` returns `'igpay'`
* `pig_latin('latin')` returns `'atinlay'`

## String methods

_Complete the following functions_:


```python
#1)
def eecummings(poem):
    """
    Converts a poem to lowercase
    
    >>> eecummings("Still I rise")
    'still i rise'
    """
```

```Python








```


```python
#1)
def emphasize(phrase, word):
    """
    Make the first occurrence of word in phrase uppercase
    
    >>> emphasize('"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers', "all")
    '"We ALL have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers'
    >>> emphasize('"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers', "gifts")
    '"We all have different GIFTS, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers'
    >>> emphasize('"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers', "Mister")
    '"We all have different gifts, so we all have different ways of saying to the world who we are." ~Fred Rogers'
    """
    
```

```Python













```


```python
#3)
def bleep(phrase, swear_words):
    """
    Replace any words in phrase in the list of swear_words with BLEEP
    
    >>> bleep("Oh crap!", ["shit", "crap"])
    'Oh BLEEP!'
    >>> bleep("Oh crap, this shit doesn't work!", ["shit", "crap"])
    "Oh BLEEP, this BLEEP doesn't work!"
    """
```

```Python











```


```python
def bleep(phrase, swear_words):
    """
    Replace any words in phrase in the list of swear_words with BLEEP
    
    >>> bleep("Oh crap!", ["shit", "crap"])
    'Oh BLEEP!'
    >>> bleep("Oh crap, this shit doesn't work!", ["shit", "crap"])
    "Oh BLEEP, this BLEEP doesn't work!"
    """
    for swear in swear_words:
        phrase = phrase.replace(swear, "BLEEP")
    return phrase
```

## String formatting

### Overview
* _Assume I wanted to write a function called `word_length` that takes a single word and prints the word and its length. For example: `word_length('rain')` should output `"rain is 4 characters long!"`. How would I write the body of the function?_
* _Now assume I wanted `word_length('rain')` to output `"rain has length 4!"` How would I change the body of the function?_
* Simpler alternative: string `format` method
    * Create a string that contains curly places as placeholders for values
    * Call `format` on the string with a list of values to fill-in the placeholders


```python
word = "rain"
print("{} has length {}!".format(word, len(word)))
```

    rain has length 4!


_Complete the following functions_:


```python
#1)
def y2k(date):
    """
    Converts a date in the format 'Month DD, YY' to 'DD Month 19YY'
    
    >>> y2k("March 02, 20")
    '02 March 1920'
    >>> y2k("January 01, 00")
    '01 January 1900'
    """
```

```Python







```


```python
#2)
def phone(number):
    """
    Converts a 10-digit integer into a phone number XXX-XXX-XXXX
    
    >>> phone(3152886298)
    '315-288-6298'
    """
```

```Python







```


```python
#3)
def date(number):
    """
    Converts an 8-digit string into MM/DD/YYYY
    
    >>> date("10272021")
    '10/27/2021'
    """
```

```Python







```

## Extra practice

_Complete the following functions_:


```python
def slice(phrase, word):
    """
    Return the slice notation (as a string) for extracting word from phrase
    
    >>> slice("A piece of pizza", "of")
    '[8:10]'
    >>> slice("A piece of pizza", "pie")
    '[2:5]'
    >>> slice("A piece of pizza", "A")
    '[:1]'
    >>> slice("A piece of pizza", "pizza")
    '[11:]'
    """
    start = phrase.find(word)
    end = start + len(word)
    if start == 0:
        start = ""
    if end == len(phrase):
        end = ""
    return "[{}:{}]".format(start, end)
```
