## Practice reading code with strings and lists
*What is the output of the following programs?*


```python
#1)
a = 'kangaroo'
b = 'penguin'
print(a[1] + b[1])
print(a[-1] + b[len(b)-1])
print(a[1:6])
print(b[:3])
```

```python
#2)
c = 'flamingo'
d = 'elephant'
for e in c:
    if e in d:
        print(e.upper())
```

<p style="height:4em;"></p>


```python
#3)
s = "globe"
for i in range(len(s)):
    t = ""
    for j in range(i):
        t = t + s[j]
    print(t)
```

<p style="height:4em;"></p>


```python
#4)
u = "bat"
v = ""
w = ""
for i in range(len(u)):
    v = v + str(i) + u[i]
    w = u[i] + w
print(v)
print(w)
```

<p style="height:5em;"></p>


```python
#5)
c = ["red", "yellow", "blue"]
w = c[0] + c[1]
print(w)
x = c[:2] + ["orange"]
print(x)
y = c
c.pop(0)
y.append("green")
print(c, y)
```

## Practice writing code with strings
\#1) Write a function called `emphasize_vowels` that makes all vowels in a string uppercase. For example:
* `emphasize_vowels('Spring')` should return `SprIng`
* `emphasize_vowels('break')` should return `brEAk`

<p style="height:25em;"></p>

\#2) Write a function called `find_reverse` that takes a phrase and a word and returns True if the word appears backwards in the phrase. For example:
* `find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'bat')` should return `True`
* `find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'tab')` should return `False`
* `find_reverse('the tab was upside down', 'saw') `should return `True`

<p style="height:25em;"></p>

## Practice writing code with lists and files
Assume the file `dimensions.csv` contains the following data:
```
sport,type,width,length
football,field,160,360
basketball,court,50,94
soccer,field,210,330
hockey,rink,85,200
tennis,court,27,78
squash,court,21,32
baseball,field,325,325
rugby,field,226,360
curling,rink,15,148
```

\#1) *Write a program that prints out the names of the columns contained in `dimensions.csv`.*

<p style="height:15em;"></p>

\#2) *Write a function called `get_sports` that returns a list of the names of the sports contained in `dimensions.csv` **sorted** in alphabetical order.*

<p style="height:20em;"></p>

\#3) *Write a program that prints out the sport name and playing surface dimensions for each sport in `dimensions.csv` whose playing surface is called a "court".*

<p style="height:20em;"></p>

\#4) *Write a function called `get_types` that returns a list of the playing surface types contained in `dimensions.csv`. Each surface type should only be inclued in the list once, even if appears in `dimensions.csv` multiple times.*

<p style="height:20em;"></p>

\#5) *Write a program that creates a new comma-separated variable (CSV) file called `areas.csv` that contains the sport name and area of the playing surface for each sport in `dimensions.csv`.*

<p style="height:15em;"></p>

## More practice reading code


```python
#1)
a = "spring"
b = ""
c = ""
i = 0
while a[i] not in "aeiou":
    b = b + a[i]
    c = c + a[len(a) - 1 - i]
    i = i + 1
print(b, c)
```

<p style="height:5em;"></p>

## More practice writing code

\#1) Write a function called `appears_both` that takes a phrase and a word and returns True if any words in the phrase appear both forward and backwards. You must use the `find_reverse` function. For example:
* `appears_both('he was using the saw')` should return `True` because `saw` and `was` appear in the sentence
* `appears_both('the tab was upside down')` should return `False`

<p style="height:20em;"></p>

\#2) *Write a program that prints out the name of each of the sports contained in `dimensions.csv`.*
