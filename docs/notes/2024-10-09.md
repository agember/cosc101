## Refactoring

Remove unnecessary `elif`


```python
def example1(num: int) -> None:
    if (num > 0):
        print("Positive")
    elif (num < 0):
        print("Negative")
    elif (num == 0):
        print("Zero")
```


```python
def example1refactored(num: int) -> None:
    if (num > 0):
        print("Positive")
    elif (num < 0):
        print("Negative")
    else:
        print("Zero")
```

```









```

Combine condition on inner if (without else) with condition on outer if using `and`


```python
def example2(x: int, y: int) -> None:
    if (x > 0):
        if (y > 0):
            print("upper right quadrant")
    elif (x < 0):
        if (y < 0):
            print("lower left quadrant")
```


```python
def example2refactored(x: int, y: int) -> None:
    if (x > 0) and (y > 0):
        print("upper right quadrant")
    elif (x < 0) and (y < 0):
        print("lower left quadrant")
```

```









```

When nested conditional contains an `else`, outer condition must be "distributed"


```python
def example3(x: int, y: int) -> None:
    if (x > 0):
        if (y > 0):
            print("upper right quadrant")
        else:
            print("lower right quadrant")
    elif (x < 0):
        if (y < 0):
            print("lower left quadrant")
        else:
            print("upper left quadrant")
```


```python
def example3recfactored(x: int, y: int) -> None:
    if (x > 0) and (y > 0):
        print("upper right quadrant")
    elif (x > 0):
        print("lower right quadrant")
    elif (x < 0) and (y < 0):
        print("lower left quadrant")
    elif (x < 0):
        print("upper left quadrant")
```

```













```

Combine sequential cases with equivalent bodies using `or`


```python
def example4(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    if (a > b):
        print("Not equal")
    elif (a < b):
        print("Not equal")
    else:
        print("Equal")
```


```python
def example4refactored(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    if (a > b) or (a < b):
        print("Not equal")
    else:
        print("Equal")
```

```












```

Prune unreachable cases


```python
def example5(year: int) -> None:
    if (year > 1819):
        print("After Colgate's founding")
    elif (year > 2000):
        print("After new millenium")
    else:
        print("Before Colgate's founding")
```


```python
def example5refactored(year: int) -> None:
    if (year > 1819):
        print("After Colgate's founding")
    else:
        print("Before Colgate's founding")
```


```python
def example5alternative(year: int) -> None:
    if (year > 1819):
        print("After Colgate's founding")
        if (year > 2000):
            print("After new millenium")
    else:
        print("Before Colgate's founding")
```

```





```

_Refactor the following function to remove unnecessary conditions and unreachable cases_


```python
def practice1(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    if (a >= b):
        print("A")
        if (a == b):
            print("D")
        elif (a != b):
            print("E")
    elif (a > b):
        print("B")
    elif (a < b):
        print("C")
        if (a + a == b):
            print("F")
        elif (2 * a == b):
            print("G")
        elif (b + b == a):
            print("H")
        else:
            print("(I")
```


```python
def practice1refactored(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    if (a >= b):
        print("A")
        if (a == b):
            print("D")
        else:
            print("E")
    elif (a < b):
        print("C")
        if (a + a == b):
            print("F")
        else:
            print("(I")
```

```













```

_Refactor the following function to eliminate nested conditionals_


```python
def practice2(m: int, n: int) -> None:
    if (m < 0):
        print("A")
    elif (m >= 0):
        if (m < 10):
            print("B")
    elif (m >= 10):
        if (m < 100):
            print("C")
        else:
            print("D")
```


```python
def practice2refactored(m: int, n: int) -> None:
    if (m < 0):
        print("A")
    elif (m >= 0) and (m < 10):
        print("B")
    elif (m >= 10) and (m < 100):
        print("C")
    elif (m >= 10): # Can further refactor to else
        print("D")
```

```










```

_Refactor the following function to eliminate as much duplicated code as possible_


```python
def practice3(q: int, r: int) -> None:
    if (q > 100):
        print("A")
    elif (q == 0):
        print("B")
    elif (r == 0):
        print("B")
    elif (r > 100):
        print("A")
    elif (r > q):
        print("A")
    else:
        print("C")
```


```python
def practice3refactored(q: int, r: int) -> None:
    if (q > 100):
        print("A")
    elif (q == 0) or (r == 0):
        print("B")
    elif (r > 100) or (r > q):
        print("A")
    else:
        print("C")
```

```










```

### Extra practice

_Write a program that asks the user for three words and prints the word with the most vowels. For example:_
```
Word 1: diversity
Word 2: equity
Word 3: inclusion
inclusion has the most vowels
```


```python
def count_vowels(word: str) -> int:
    vowels = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter in "aeiou":
            vowels = vowels + 1
    return vowels

def main() -> None:
    most = ""
    for i in range(1,4):
        word = input("Word "+str(i)+": ")
        if (count_vowels(word) > count_vowels(most)):
            most = word
    print(most, "has the most vowels")

main()
```

    Word 1:  diversity
    Word 2:  equity
    Word 3:  inclusion


    inclusion has the most vowels


```












```

_Write a program that asks the user how many slices are desired for each of three different kinds of pizza and computes the number of pizzas of each kind to purchase. Assume one pizza has 8 slices. For example:_
```
How many pieces of cheese pizza?  15
Order 2 cheese pizza(s)
How many pieces of pepperoni pizza?  10
Order 2 pepperoni pizza(s)
How many pieces of veggie pizza?  8
Order 1 veggie pizza(s)
```


```python
def slices_to_pizzas(slices: int) -> int:
    if (slices % 8 > 0):
        extra = 8 - (slices % 8)
        slices = slices + extra
    return slices // 8

def main() -> None:
    for kind in ["cheese", "pepperoni", "veggie"]:
        slices = int(input("How many pieces of "+kind+" pizza? "))
        pizzas = slices_to_pizzas(slices)
        print("Order", pizzas, kind, "pizza(s)")
        
main()
```

    How many pieces of cheese pizza?  15


    Order 2 cheese pizza(s)


    How many pieces of pepperoni pizza?  10


    Order 2 pepperoni pizza(s)


    How many pieces of veggie pizza?  8


    Order 1 veggie pizza(s)


```














```

    if (month == "March" and day >= 21) or (month == "April" and day <= 19):
        return "Aries"
    elif (month == "April" and day >= 20) or (month == "May" and day <= 20):
        return "Taurus"
    elif (month == "May" and day >= 21) or (month == "June" and day <= 21):
        return "Gemini"

    elif (month == "July" and day >= 23) or (month == "August" and day <= 22):
        return "Leo"
    elif (month == "August" and day >= 23) or (month == "September" and day <= 22):
        return "Virgo"
    elif (month == "September" and day >= 23) or (month == "October" and day <= 23):
        return "Libra"
    elif (month == "October" and day >= 24) or (month == "November" and day <= 21):
        return "Scorpio"
    elif (month == "November" and day >= 22) or (month == "December" and day <= 21):
        return "Sagittarius"
    elif (month == "December" and day >= 22) or (month == "January" and day <= 19):
        return "Capricorn"
    elif (month == "January" and day >= 20) or (month == "Feburary" and day <= 18):
        return "Aquarius"
    else:
        return "Pisces"
```

_Write a function called `flips` that flips a coin a specified number of times and returns the percentage of flips that were heads._


```python
import random
def flips(count: int) -> float:
    heads = 0
    for i in range(0, count):
        coin = random.randint(0,1)
        if (coin == 0):
            heads += 1
    percent = heads/count * 100
    return percent

print(flips(50))
```

    52.0


```
