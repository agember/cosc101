# recursion
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-12-01_

## Announcements
* Homework #9 due tomorrow @ 5pm
* DEI reflection due Monday @ 11pm

## Warm-up
*Assume each line of the file `synonyms.txt` contains a word followed by one or more synonyms, e.g.:*
```
small little compact tiny
large big huge immense vast
tall large towering 
```
*Write a function called `load_synonyms` that reads the file and returns a dictionary containing the words and their corresponding list of synonyms, e.g.:*
```
{'small' : ['little','compact','tiny'], 
 'large' : ['big','huge','immense','vast'], 
 'tall' : ['large','towering']}
```

```



















```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems.

## Recursion

_For each of the following problems:_
1. _What is the condition and result for the base case?_
2. _What is the smaller problem on which you recurse?_
3. _How do you combine the simple piece and the result of the recursive call?_

\#1) Count the number of people between you and the left wall of the classroom, including yourself

```








```

\#2) Sum the numbers in a list

```








```

\#3) Reverse the characters in a string (e.g., `COLGATE` becomes `ETAGLOC`

```








```

## Extra practice
\#1) _Write a recursive function called `sumr` that sums the numbers in a list_

```











```

\#2) _Write a recursive function called `reverser` that reverses the characters in a string_
