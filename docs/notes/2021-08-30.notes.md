_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-08-30_

## Announcements
* Masks are required in class
* Before next class: read sections 2.1-2.7, 9.3 and answer pre-class questions

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Computational thinking
* Programming
* Hello, Python!
* Errors and debugging

## Warm-up
What is an example of an algorithm you lookup and execute in real life?
(Recall: an algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that solve a problem.)

## Computational thinking
* _Computational thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution(s) in such a way that a computer—human or machine—can effectively carry out._ -- Jeannette M. Wing
    * Decomposition — break the problem into smaller sub-problems
    * Pattern recognition — look for similarities with previously solved problems, across sub-problems, within sub-problems, etc.
    * Abstraction — determine which details are important
    * Algorithm design — create unambiguous step-by-step instructions
* Example: How do I grow flowers?
* _Decomposition_
    * How do I prepare the soil?
    * How do I plant the seeds?
    * How do I care for the plants?
* _Pattern recognition_
    * Growing flowers is similar to growing vegetables
    * Repeat steps for each plant
    * Repeat care steps every day
* _Abstraction_
    * Assume pot is provided
    * Assume filling a water can is known
* _Algorithm — e.g., plant the seeds_
    1. How do I prepare the soil?
        1. Get an empty pot
        2. Fill the pot to the top with soil
    2. How do I plant the seeds? — steps for each seed:
        1. Make a hole that is 1 cm deep
        2. Place a seed in the hole
        3. Cover the seed with soil
    3. How do I care for the plants?
        1. Place the pot in the sun
        2. Water the plants daily
* Ambiguity — humans rely on contextual clues and experience; computers do _exactly_ what you tell them
    * Make a hole that is 1 cm deep does not specify the width
    * Cover the seed with soil does not specify how much soil
    * Water the plants daily does not specify how much water

## Computational thinking practice
(1) _Draw a simple picture (e.g., a stick figure)._

(2) _Write a set of steps someone should take (i.e., an algorithm) to draw the same picture._

(3) _Swap instructions with your neighbor and follow their instructions._

(4) _Compare your drawings. How well does what you drew match up with what your neighbor originally drew? How can you improve your instructions?_

## Programming
* _Recall: what is programming?_ — representing algorithms in a notation (language) that can be followed by a computer
* Natural language is inherently ambiguous
    * A robot could not follow our algorithm for growing flowers
* Programming languages are unambiguous — an instruction has exactly one meaning	
* _What are the basic types of instructions used by Python (and nearly every programming language)?_
    * Receiving input — e.g., from keyboard
    * Providing output — e.g., display text on screen
    * Math and logic
    * Conditional execution
    * Repetition

## Hello Python
* Two modes of programming in Python
    * Type instructions into interpreter (console) — instructions are executed as they are entered
    * Type instructions in a file — instructions are executed when file is read by interpreter (run)
* First program


```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

    Hello, Python!


## Errors

* Debugging — process of correcting errors (or bugs) in your program
* Grace Hopper (an officer in the Navy) found a dead moth on a relay in one of the first computers (the Harvard Mark II) caused a problem, and the name bug stuck

* _What are the three kinds of errors that can occur in a program? When are they detected?_
    * Syntax error — a grammatical error
        * Detected when you enter an instruction into the interpreter
    * Runtime error — infeasible instructions
        * Detected when the interpreter executes the instruction
    * Semantic error — wrong instructions
        * Detected when a human examines the program's output

_What type of error exists in each of the following programs?_ 


```python
print("six plus seven is...")
6-7
```

    six plus seven is





    -1




Semantic — output is unexpected


```python
print("Lucky number 13"
```


      File "/var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_29667/3286650260.py", line 1
        print("Lucky number 13"
                               ^
    SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing



Syntax — missing parenthesis


```python
13 / 0
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_29667/181629082.py in <module>
    ----> 1 13 / 0
    

    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero


Runtime — cannot divide by zero


```python
PRINT("13 men who offered $13 and 13 prayers")
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_29667/2100839225.py in <module>
    ----> 1 PRINT("13 men who offered $13 and 13 prayers")
    

    NameError: name 'PRINT' is not defined


Syntax — Python is case-sensitive
