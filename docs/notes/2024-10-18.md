# Iteration: break and continue
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-10-18_

## Announcements
* Homework 6
    * Parts 1 and 2 with a partner due Tuesday @ 10am
    * Part 3 due Friday 

## break and continue

* `break` is used to exit a loop regardless of the status of the continuation condition
* `continue` is used to stop the current iteration, recheck the continuation condition, and possibly iterate again


```python
def total_sold_abort(goal: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while (total < goal):
        sold = int(input("How many did you sell? "))
        if (sold < 0):
            break
        total += sold
    return total

total_sold_abort(10)
```

    How many did you sell?  5
    How many did you sell?  4
    How many did you sell?  -1

```python
def total_sold_retry(goal: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while (total < goal):
        sold = int(input("How many did you sell? "))
        if (sold < 0):
            print("Must be a positive number")
            continue
        total += sold
    return total

total_sold_retry(10)
```

    How many did you sell?  5
    How many did you sell?  4
    How many did you sell?  -1


    Must be a positive number


    How many did you sell?  3

## Practice

_Write a function called `ask_question` that takes a yes/no question and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the user answered yes or no, respectively. (Hint: use the polling pattern)_


```python
def ask_question(question):
    choice = ""
    while choice not in ["yes", "no"]:
        choice = input(question + " (yes/no) ")
    if choice == "yes":
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

```










```

_Write a function called `total_caffeine` that asks the user to enter the milligrams (mg) of caffeine for each beverage they consumed in a day until the user indicates they are done consuming beverages. The function should return the total caffeine consumed. (Hint: use the sentinel pattern and the accumulator pattern)_


```python
def total_caffeine():
    total = 0
    still_consuming = True
    while still_consuming:
        content = int(input("How many mg of caffeine did the beverage contain? "))
        if (content < 0):
            still_consuming = False
        else:
            total = total + content
    return total
```

```

_Discount Airlines, Inc. has asked you to write a Python program to help its customers calculate how many reward miles they have earned. Your program should repeatedly ask the user for the distance of a flight until the user enters 0. Then your program will output the total number of miles flown and whether the customer achieved bronze (less than 20,000 miles flown), silver (20,000-50,000 miles flown), or gold (more than 50,000 miles flown) status._


```python
def get_miles() -> int:
    more_flights = True
    total_distance = 0
    count = 0
    while more_flights:
        dist = int(input("What was the distance of flight " + str(count + 1) + "? "))
        if dist == 0:
            more_flights = False
        else:
            count = count + 1
            total_distance = total_distance + dist
    return total_distance
    
def main() -> None:
    total_distance = get_miles()
    print("You flew", str(total_distance), "miles.")
    if total_distance < 20000:
        print("You earned bronze status.")
    elif total_distance <= 50000:
        print("You earned silver status.")
    else:
        print("You earned gold status.")

main()
```

    What was the distance of flight 1?  1000
    What was the distance of flight 2?  2000
    What was the distance of flight 3?  15000
    What was the distance of flight 4?  0


    You flew 18000 miles.
    You earned bronze status.

Customers at the Cost Mincer grocery store have complained about the long checkout lines, so the store manager wants to measure the average checkout time per item. Your task is to write a program that, for each customer, asks for the number of items purchased and the time required to complete the transaction. The program should continue to ask for inputs until 0 is entered for the number of items. After all inputs have been entered, the program should output the average checkout time per item.

Example input/output:
```
Number of items? 20
Checkout time (seconds)? 80
Number of items? 60
Checkout time (seconds)? 160
Number of items? 0
Average checkout time per item is 3.0 seconds
```


```python
def main() -> None:
    done = False
    total_items = 0
    total_time = 0
    while not done:
        items = int(input("Number of items? "))
        if items == 0:
            done = True
        else:
            time = int(input("Checkout time (seconds)? "))
            total_items += items
            total_time += time
    
    average = total_time / total_items
    print("Average checkout time per item is", average, "seconds")
main()
```

    Number of items?  20
    Checkout time (seconds)?  80
    Number of items?  60
    Checkout time (seconds)?  160
    Number of items?  0


    Average checkout time per item is 3.0 seconds
