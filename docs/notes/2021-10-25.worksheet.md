_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-10-25_

## Announcements
* Homework 6 due Thursday

## Warm-up
_For each of the following programs, fill-in the blanks such that the program produces the expected output._


```python
#1)
phrase1 = "Let it go, "
phrase2 = "Can't hold it back anymore."
print(__________ * __________ + __________)
phrase3 = "Turn away and slam the door."
print(__________ * __________ + __________)
print("~Elsa from Frozen")
```

Expected output:
```
Let it go, Let it go, Can't hold it back anymore.
Let it go, Let it go, Turn away and slam the door.
~Elsa from Frozen

#2)
suffix = "ice"
for __________________________________:
    print(__________ + suffix)
```

Expected output:
```
dice
rice
slice
twice
```

## String indexing

_For each of the following programs, fill-in the blanks such that the program produces the expected output._


```python
#1)
name = "Ruth Bader Ginsburg"
initials = name[___] + name[___] + name[___]
print(initials)
result = __________
for letter in initials:
    result += __________ + __________
print(result)
```

Expected output:
```
R.B.G.
```


```python
#2)
full = "New York"
abbreviation = full[-___] + full[-___]
print(abbreviation)
```

Expected output:
```
NY
```

## String slicing

_For each of the following programs, fill-in the blanks such that the program produces the expected output._


```python
#1)
line1 = "You may write me down in history"
print(line1)
line2 = "W" + line1[___:___] + line1[-___] + " your bitter, twisted lies,"
print(line2)
line3 = line1[:___] + "trod me" + line1[-___:-___] + "the very dirt"
print(line3)
line4 = "But still" + line2[___] + " like dust" + line2[___] + " I'll rise."
print(line4)
```

Expected output:
```
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.
~Maya Angelou
```


```python
#2)
sport = 'figure skating'
print(sport[___:___])
print(sport[:___])
print(sport[___] + sport[___:])
print(sport[-___:-___])
```

Expected output:
```
tin
figure
king
kat
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>


```python
#3)
line1 = "When the light is gr" + "e" * ___ + "n you go."
print(line1)
line2 = line1[:___] + "red" + line1[-___:-___] + "stop."
print(line2)
print("But what do you do")
line4 = line2[:___] + "turns blue"
print(line4)
print("With orange and lavender spots?")
print("~Shel Silverstein")
```

Expected output:
```
When the light is green you go.
When the light is red you stop.
But what do you do
When the light turns blue
With orange and lavender spots?
~Shel Silverstein
```

## Programmatic poetry
_Write a program that outputs part of a poem or song lyrics. Your program **must** use string:_
* Concatenation
* Repetition
* Indexing
* Slicing
