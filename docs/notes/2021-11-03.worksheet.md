## Announcements
* Homework 7 due tomorrow at 5pm

## Warm-up
\#1) *Assume a list of integers has been assigned to the variable `nums`. Write a snippet of code that updates each item in the list to be twice its old value. For example: `[1, 3, 5]` would be updated to `[2, 6, 10]`*

<p style="height:10em;"></p>

\#2) *Assume a list of integers has been assigned to the variable `nums`. Write a snippet of code that updates each item to be the sum of the values up to and including the item being updated. For example: `[1, 3, 5]` would be updated to `[1, 4, 9]`*

<p style="height:10em;"></p>

\#3) *Assume a list of strings has been assigned to the variable `words`. Write a snippet of code that updates each item to be only the first three letters of the original item. For example: `["January", "February", "March"]` would be updated to `["Jan", "Feb", "Mar"]`*

ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems.

## References and aliasing practice
_Draw a reference diagram for each of the following programs and determine the program's output._


```python
#1)
a = [10, 20, 30, 40]
b = a[1:3]
c = b
c[0] = 15
print("A", a, "B", b, "C", c)
```

```python
#2)
def swapZero(d, e):
    f = d
    d[0] = e[0]
    e[0] = f[0]
    
u = [1, 3, 5]
v = [2, 4, 6]
swapZero(u, v)
print("U", u, "V", v)
```

```python
#3)
def swapOne(g, h):
    i = g[:]
    g[1] = h[1]
    h[1] = i[1]

w = [1, 3, 5]
x = [2, 4, 6]
swapOne(w, x)
print("W", w, "X", x)
```

```python
#4)
def swapTwo(p, q):
    r = p[:]
    s = q[:]
    r[1] = s[1]
    s[1] = p[1]
    
y = [1, 3, 5]
z = [2, 4, 6]
swapTwo(y, z)
print("Y", y, "Z", z)
```

```python
#5)
j = [5, 10]
k = j
j = j + [15]
print("J", j, "K", k)
```

```python
#6)
m = [5, 10]
n = m
m = m.append(15)
print("M", m, "N", n)
```

## Extra practice

\#1) *Assume a list of strings has been assigned to the variable `words`. Write a snippet of code that updates every other item (starting with the zeroth item) to be the reverse of the original item. For example: `["January", "February", "March"]` would be updated to `["yraunaJ", "February", "hcraM"]`*

<p style="height:10em;"></p>

\#2) Write a function called `remove_false_original` that takes a list of boolean values and removes all False values from the list.

<p style="height:20em;"></p>

\#3) Write a function called `remove_false_copy` that takes a list of boolean values and returns a copy of the list with all False values removed. The original list should not be modified.
