# docstrings; top-down vs. bottom-up programming
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-10-01_

## Announcements
* Homework 4 due Thursday

## Warm-up: docstrings
_Write a good docstring for each of the following functions_


```python
#1)
def funcA(w, x):
    if (w < x):
        return w
    else:
        return x
```

```

```


```python
#2)
def funcB(v):
    return (v % 2) == 0
```

```

```


```python
#3)
def funcC(n):
    p = n % 10
    if p <= 5:
        return n - p
    else:
        return n + (10 - p)
```

```

```


```python
#4)
import math
def funcD(r):
    return math.pi * (r ** 2)
```

```

```

## Top-down design practice
\#1) _Design a program that asks a user for a paragraph of text and counts the number of characters, words, and sentences in the paragraph. (You may assume there is a single space between every word and a period at the end of every sentence.) **Your design should consist of function definitions and docstrings; also, add a comment in a function's body if it should call one of the other functions.**_

\#2) _Design a program that helps a user construct a monthly budget. The program should ask for a userâ€™s annual income, fixed expenses (e.g., rent, groceries, phone), and desired allocation among variable expenses (e.g., clothing, travel). Assume 20% of a userâ€™s annual income is put into savings. **Your design should consist of function definitions and docstrings; also, add a comment in a function's body if it should call one of the other functions.**_

## Bottom-up programming practice
_Implement each of the functions included in the design of your programs. **Start with the lowest-level function.**_
