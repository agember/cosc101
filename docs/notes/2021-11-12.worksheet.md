# data analysis
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-11-12_

## Announcements
* Exam 3 Wednesday
    * Study materials posted on Moodle

## Warm-up
*Modify the code below such that the `read_data` function returns `None`, instead of causing the program to crash, if the file does not exist*


```python
def read_data(filename):
    '''Read data from a file'''
    infile = open(filename, 'r')
    data = infile.read()
    infile.close()
    return data

def main():
    data = read_data('seasons.txt')
    print(data)
    data = read_data('does-not-exist.txt')
    print(data)
    
main()
```

## Reading data
\#1) *Write a function called `load_data` that takes the name of a comma-separated variable (CSV) file and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the values from a single row (i.e., line) of the CSV file.*

*For example, assume `sample.csv` contains the following:*
```Python
Apricot,Orange,Fruit
Blueberry,Blue,Fruit
Carrot,Orange,Vegetable
```

`load_data('sample.csv')` should return:
```Python
[['Apricot','Orange','Fruit'], ['Blueberry','Blue','Fruit'], ['Carrot','Orange','Vegetable']]
```

## Filtering data
\#2) *Write a function called `select_columns` which takes a list of lists (as returned by `load_data`), a starting index, and an ending index, and and returns a list of lists in which each sublist only contains the items from the starting index up to (but not including) the ending index.*

*For example, assume:*
```Python
data = [['Apricot','Orange','Fruit'], ['Blueberry','Blue','Fruit'], ['Carrot','Orange','Vegetable']]
```

*`select_columns(data, 0, 2)` should return:*
```Python
[['Apricot','Orange'], ['Blueberry','Blue'], ['Carrot','Orange']]
```

\#3) *Write a function called `select_rows` which takes a list of lists (as returned by `load_data`), a column index, and a desired value, and returns a list of lists which only includes the sublists from the original list of lists that had the specified value in the specified index.*

*For example, assume:*
```Python
data = [['Apricot','Orange','Fruit'], ['Blueberry','Blue','Fruit'], ['Carrot','Orange','Vegetable']]
```

*`select_rows(data, 2, 'Fruit')` should return:*
```Python
[['Apricot','Orange','Fruit'], ['Blueberry','Blue','Fruit']]
```

*Similarly, `select_rows(data, 1, 'Orange')` should return:*
```Python
[['Apricot','Orange','Fruit'], ['Carrot','Orange','Vegetable']]
```

## Saving data
\#4) *Write a function called `save_data` that takes a list of lists and the name of a comma-separated variable (CSV) file and writes each sublist as a "row" in the CSV file.*

*For example, assume:*
```Python
data = [['Orange','Fruit'], ['Blue','Fruit'], ['Orange','Vegetable']]
```

*`save_data(data, 'filtered.csv')` should create a file called `filtered.csv` which contains the following:*
```Python
Orange,Fruit
Blue,Fruit
Orange,Vegetable
```

## Extra practice
\#5) *Write a function called `select_single_column` that takes a list of lists and a column index, and returns a list containing the values in that column from every row.*

*For example, assume:*
```Python
data = [['Apricot','Orange','Fruit'], ['Blueberry','Blue','Fruit'], ['Carrot','Orange','Vegetable']]
```

*`select_single_column(data, 0)` should return:*
```Python
['Apricot', 'Blueberry', 'Carrot']
```

\#6) *Write a function called `select_single_row` that takes a list of lists and a row index, and returns a list containing the values in that row from every column.*

*For example, assume:*
```Python
data = [['Apricot','Orange','Fruit'], ['Blueberry','Blue','Fruit'], ['Carrot','Orange','Vegetable']]
```

*`select_single_row(data, 1)` should return:*
```Python
['Blueberry', 'Blue', 'Fruit']
```
