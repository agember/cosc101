## Mapping patterns to loops

* Process
    1. Identify repeated tasks â€” tasks may not be _exactly_ the same
    2. Determine which repeated tasks can be "collated"

        ![Collated vs uncollated](figures/for_loops/collated-vs-uncollated.png)

    3. Determine how many times the "collated" tasks need to be repeated
    4. Write the tasks, using the loop variable to accommodate _slight_ differences between repetitions

* Example


```python
def contribute(thing: str) -> float:
    """
    Determine user's annual contributions to something

    Parameters:
        item: item to which the user contributed
    Return:
        amount user contributed in a year
    """
    monthly = float(input("How much did you contribute to "+thing+" each month? $"))
    annually = monthly * 12
    return annually
    
def compute_deductions() -> float:
    """
    Calculate total deduction based on contributions

    Return:
        user's total deducation
    """
    charity = contribute("charity")
    total = charity
    ira = contribute("a traditional IRA")
    total = total + ira
    education = contribute("education costs")
    total = total + education
    return total
```


```python
def compute_deductions() -> float:
    """
    Calculate total deduction based on contributions

    Return:
        user's total deducation
    """
    total = 0
    for thing in ["charity", "a traditional IRA", "education costs"]:
        amount = contribute(thing)
        total = total + amount
    return total
```

```










```


```python
def taxable(income: float, deductions: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate taxable income

    Parameters:
        income: annual income
        deductions: total deductions
    Return:
        taxable income
    """
    taxable = income - deductions
    return taxable
    
def main():
    income = float(input("How much did you earn last year? $"))
    deductions = compute_deductions()
    net = taxable(income, deductions)
    print("Your taxable income is $"+str(net))

main()
```

    How much did you earn last year? $ 50000
    How much did you contribute to charity each month? $ 50
    How much did you contribute to a traditional IRA each month? $ 100
    How much did you contribute to education costs each month? $ 75


    Your taxable income is $47300.0


_Each of the following programs contains redundant code. Rewrite the program to use a loop and eliminate the redundancy._


```python
import random
def main() -> None:
    die1 = random.randrange(0,6)
    die2 = random.randrange(0,6)
    die3 = random.randrange(0,6)
    print("Die 1: " + str(die1))
    print("Die 2: " + str(die2))
    print("Die 3: " + str(die3))

main()
```


```python
import random
def main() -> None:
    for num in [1,2,3]:
        die = random.randrange(0,6)
        print("Die " + str(num) + ": " + str(die))
        
main()
```

```










```


```python
def main() -> None:
    months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun"]
    days = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30]
    print(months[0] + " has " + str(days[0]) + " days")
    print(months[1] + " has " + str(days[1]) + " days")
    print(months[2] + " has " + str(days[2]) + " days")
    print(months[3] + " has " + str(days[3]) + " days")
    print(months[4] + " has " + str(days[4]) + " days")
    print(months[5] + " has " + str(days[5]) + " days")
main()
```


```python
def main() -> None:
    months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun"]
    days = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30]
    for num in range(len(months)):
        print(months[num] + " has " + str(days[num]) + " days")

main()
```

```










```


```python
def main() -> None:
    initials = ""
    first = input("What is your first name? ")
    initials = initials + first[0] + "."
    middle = input("What is your middle name? ")
    initials = initials + middle[0] + "."
    last = input("What is your last name? ")
    initials = initials + last[0] + "."
    print("Your initials are " + initials)

```python

    for part in ["first", "middle", "last"]:
        name = input("What is your " + part + " name? ")
        initials = initials + name[0] + "."

ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above questions; if you have extra time **skip** to the extra practice.

_Write a program that asks a user how many steps they walked each day of the week and computes their step total for the week. For example:_

```
How many steps did you walk on Sun?  2000
How many steps did you walk on Mon?  7000
How many steps did you walk on Tues?  8500
How many steps did you walk on Wed?  7312
How many steps did you walk on Thurs?  8324
How many steps did you walk on Fri?  6381
How many steps did you walk on Sat?  2319
You walked 41836 steps this week
```


```python
def main() -> None:
    week_steps = 0
    for day in ["Sun","Mon","Tues","Wed","Thurs","Fri","Sat"]:
        daily_steps = input("How many steps did you walk on "+day+"? ")
        week_steps += int(daily_steps)
    print("You walked " + str(week_steps) + " steps this week")

main()
```

```










```

_Write a program that asks for a whole number and outputs:_
1. _The number of digits in the number_
2. _The sum of the digits in the number_
3. _The digits in reverse order_
4. _Every other digit, starting with the first digit_
5. _The sum of the digits printed above_

_For example:_
```
Enter a number:  13346
There are 5 digits in the number
The sum of the digits is 17
The reversed number is 64331
Including every other digit yields 136
The sum of these digits is 10
```


```python
def sum(num: str) -> None:
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(num)):
        total = total + int(num[i])
    return total

def reverse(num: str) -> None:
    rev = ""
    for digit in num:
        rev = digit + rev
    return rev

def skip(num: str) -> None:
    part = ""
    for i in range(0, len(num), 2):
        part = part + num[i]
    return part

def main() -> None:
    num = input("Enter a number: ")
    print("There are " + str(len(num)) + " digits in the number")
    print("The sum of the digits is " + str(sum(num)))
    print("The reversed number is " + reverse(num))
    part = skip(num)
    print("Including every other digit yields " + part)
    print("The sum of these digits is " + str(sum(part)))

main()
```

```

























```

_Write a program that asks for the dimensions of multiple rooms and computes the total square footage of a house or apartment. For example:_

```
What is the length of the living room?  20
What is the width of the living room?  10
What is the length of the kitchen?  15
What is the width of the kitchen?  10
What is the length of the bedroom?  12
What is the width of the bedroom?  10
What is the length of the bathroom?  8
What is the width of the bathroom?  6
The total square footage is 518.0
```


```python
def area(room: str) -> int:
    length = float(input("What is the length of the " + room + "? "))
    width = float(input("What is the width of the " + room + "? "))
    room_area = length * width
    return room_area
    
def main() -> None:
    total_area = 0.0
    for room in ["living room", "kitchen", "bedroom", "bathroom"]:
        total_area = total_area + area(room)
    print("The total square footage is " + str(total_area))

main()
```

```















```

## Extra practice

_Write a program that flips a coin as many times as the user requested and outputs the percentage of flips that were head. (Hint: use 0 for tails and 1 for heads)_


```python
import random
def main() -> None:
    # Ask for number of flips
    flips = int(input("How many flips? "))
    heads = 0
    # Flip and count heads
    for i in range(flips):
        coin = random.randint(0,1)
        heads = heads + coin
    # Display results
    percent = heads/flips * 100
    print(str(percent)+"% of the flips were heads")

main()
```
