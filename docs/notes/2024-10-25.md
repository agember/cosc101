## Announcements
* Exam 2 in class on Monday
    * Combination of code reading and code writing
    * Emphasizes conditional statements and while loops – still includes material covered earlier

## Code tracing

_What output is produced by the following function for each of the calls below?_


```python
def mystery(a: int, b: float, c: str) -> None:
    if (a > 10):
        if (b > 10 and a <= 15):
            print('1')
        else:
            print('2')
        print('12')
    elif (a < 5):
        if (c == 'cat'):
            print('3')
    else:
        print('45')
        if (c == 'dog' or b > 10):
            print ('4')
        else:
            print('5')
```


```python
mystery(11, 9, "cat")
```

    2
    12


```

```


```python
mystery(10, 11, "dog")
```

    45
    4


```

```


```python
mystery(4, 11, "dog")
```

_No output_

```

```


```python
mystery(7, 15, "cat")
```

    45
    4


```

```

_What does the following function output for each of the calls below?_


```python
def magic(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    c = b * b
    while (a > b):
        print(a, c)
        c = a % c
        a = a - 1
    print(a + c)
```


```python
magic(6, 3)
```

    6 9
    5 6
    4 5
    7


```









```


```python
magic(10, 5)
```

    10 25
    9 10
    8 9
    7 8
    6 7
    11


```










```


```python
magic(3, 5)
```

    28


```










```

## Writing code

_Write a program that asks for a day in October and prints:_

* _"Diwali" if the day is 31_
* _"Fire Prevention Week" if the day is between 6 and 12 (inclusive)_
* _"Halloween” if the day is 31_
* _"Hispanic Heritage Month" if the day is between 1 and 15 (inclusive)_
* _"Indigenous Peoples' Day” if the day is 14_
* _"World Mental Health Day" if the day is 10_

_The celebrations **must** be printed in alphabetical order._


```python
def main() -> None:
    day = int(input('Day in October? '))
    
    if (day <= 15):
        if (day >= 6 and day <= 12):
            print("Fire Prevention Week")
        print("Hispanic Heritage Month")
        if (day == 14):
            print("Indigenous Peoples' Day")
        elif (day == 10):
            print("World Mental Health Day")
    elif (day == 31):
        print("Halloween")
        print("Diwali")
main()
```

```


















```

_Write a program that asks a user to enter words (one word at a time) until they have entered at least 15 characters. Words less than 3 characters should be ignored. The program should output the average length of the words the user entered._


```python
def main() -> None:
    chars = 0
    count = 0
    while (chars < 15):
        word = input("Word: ")
        if len(word) >= 3:
            chars += len(word)
            count += 1
    print("Average: ", chars / count)
main()
```

```
















```

_Write a function called `pete_and_repeat` that asks the user the following riddle: `Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out, who was left?` If the user enters (`Repeat`), then the program should again ask the user to answer the riddle. If the user enters something else, then the program should print (`Wrong answer`) and again ask the user to answer the riddle._

_Example output:_
```
Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out, who was left? Repeat
Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out, who was left? Repeat
Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out, who was left? Pete
Wrong answer
Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out, who was left? Repeat
...
```


```python
def pete_and_repeat():
    answer = ""
    while answer == "Repeat" or answer != "Repeat":
        answer = input("Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out, who was left? ")
        if answer != "Repeat":
            print("Wrong answer")
pete_and_repeat()
```

```











```

_The value of the mathematical constant pi (π) can be estimed using the Madhava-Leibniz series:_
```
π = 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 ...
```
_Write a function called `estimate_pi` that uses the Madhava_Leibniz series to estimate pi until the estimate rounded to two decimal digits is `3.14`._


```python
def estimate_pi():
    """
    >>> estimate_pi()
    3.1350137774059244
    """
    add = True
    estimate = 0.0
    i = 1
    while round(estimate, 2) != 3.14:
        if add:
            estimate = estimate + 4/i
            add = False
        else:
            estimate = estimate - 4/i
            add = True
        i = i + 2
    return estimate
```

```
