## Warm-up
_What is the output of this program?_


```python
def func1(x, y):
    print(x, y)
    return x + y

def func2(x, y):
    z = x
    x = y
    y = z
    print(x, y)

x = "A"
y = "B"
result1 = func1(x, y)
print(result1)
result2 = func2(x, y)
print(x, y, result2)
```

    A B
    AB
    B A
    A B None


```

## Modular programming

* Final program from last class demonstrates modular programming
    * Recall: decomposition (breaking a problem into sub-problems) is the first step of computational thinking
    * Recall: a good programming practice is to decompose the solution and implement one step at a time


```python
def compute_exam_average(exam1, exam2, exam3):
    total = exam1 + exam2 + exam3
    average = total / 3
    return average

def convert_to_letter(grade):
    if grade >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif grade >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif grade >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif grade >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

percent = compute_exam_average(75, 85, 80)
letter = convert_to_letter(percent)
print("Exam grade:", letter, str(percent) + "%")
```

    Exam grade: B 80.0%


* Modular programming also enables code reuse


```python
def compute_homework_average(hw1, hw2, hw3, hw4, hw5):
    total = hw1 + hw2 + hw3 + hw4 + hw5
    average = total / 5
    return average

percent = compute_homework_average(95, 90, 93, 87, 95)
letter = convert_to_letter(percent)
print("Homework grade:", letter, str(percent) + "%")
```

    Homework grade: A 92.0%


### Practice

_Convert each of the following programs into a modular version with at least one function_


```python
#1)
standard_wall_height = 10

# Calculate square feet of wall space in offices
office_short_wall = standard_wall_height * 8
office_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 12
per_office = 2 * office_short_wall + 2 * office_long_wall
total_office = 10 * per_office

# Calculate square feet of wall space in classrooms
classroom_short_wall = standard_wall_height * 25
classroom_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 40
per_classroom = 2 * classroom_short_wall + 2 * classroom_long_wall
total_classroom = 4 * per_classroom

# Calculate square feet of wall space in hallways
hallway_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 150
per_hallway = 2 * hallway_long_wall
total_hallway = 2 * per_hallway

# Calculate square feet of wall space in total
total = total_office + total_classroom + total_hallway
print(total)
```

    15200



```python
standard_wall_height = 10

def room_walls(width, length):
    wallA = standard_wall_height * width
    wallB = standard_wall_height * length
    return 2 * wallA + 2 * wallB

def rooms_total(count, width, length):
    return count * room_walls(width, length)

total_floor = rooms_total(10, 8, 12) + rooms_total(4, 25, 40) + rooms_total(2, 0, 150)
print(total_floor)
```

    15200



```python
#2)
wins = 0

# First game
colgate_score = 0
boston_college_score = 51
if (colgate_score > boston_college_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("Boston College won")

# Second game
colgate_score = 3
stony_brook_score = 24
if (colgate_score > stony_brook_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("Stony Brook won")
    
# Third game
colgate_score = 7
wm_score = 27
if (colgate_score > wm_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("W&M won")
    
print("Colgate won", wins, "games")
```

    Boston College won
    Stony Brook won
    W&M won
    Colgate won 0 games



```python
def winner(colgate_score, oponent, oponent_score):
    if (colgate_score > oponent_score):
        print("Colgate won")
        win = True
    else:
        print(oponent, "won")
        win = False
    return win

wins = 0
if (winner(0, "Boston College", 51)):
    wins = wins + 1
if (winner(3, "Stony Brook", 24)):
    wins = wins + 1
if (winner(7, "W&M", 27)):
    wins = wins + 1 
print("Colgate won", wins, "games")
```

    Boston College won
    Stony Brook won
    W&M won
    Colgate won 0 games


## main function

### Overview
* Include a function called `main` with the primary set of statements the program should execute
* Calling the function `main` is a common convention, but this name is not required
* The only code that should appear outside of a function is a call to `main` (at the very end of the code)

### Example


```python
def main():
    wins = 0
    if (winner(0, "Boston College", 51)):
        wins = wins + 1
    if (winner(3, "Stony Brook", 24)):
        wins = wins + 1
    if (winner(7, "W&M", 27)):
        wins = wins + 1 
    print("Colgate won", wins, "games")

main()
```

    Boston College won
    Stony Brook won
    W&M won
    Colgate won 0 games


## docstrings

### Overview
* Special category of comment that summarizes what a function does
* A triple-double-quoted (`"""`) string placed directly after the function header
* Example:


```python
def add(a, b):
    """Adds two numbers"""
    sum = a + b
    return sum
```

* A good docstring should:
    * Be useful
        * Bad example: `"""Performs math"""`
    * Be concise â€” at most a sentence
        * Bad example: `"""This function computes the result of adding two numbers together to obtain their sum."""`
    * Not describe the line(s) of code in the function body
        * Bad example: `"""Applies the addition operator to variables a and b"""`

### Practice

_Write a good docstring for each of the following functions_


```python
#1)
def funcA(w, x):
    if (w < x):
        return w
    else:
        return x
```

`"""Computes the minimum"""`


```python
#2)
def funcB(v):
    return (v % 2) == 0
```

`"""Determines if a number is even"""`


```python
#3)
def funcC(n):
    p = n % 10
    if p <= 5:
        return n - p
    else:
        return n + (10 - p)
```

`"""Rounds a number to the nearest multiple of ten"""`


```python
#4)
import math
def funcD(r):
    return math.pi * (r ** 2)
```

`"""Computes the area of a circle"""`

## Extra practice

_What is the output of each of the following programs?_


```python
#1)
def func1(a, b, c):
    print(b)
    print(a)
    print(c + a)
    return a + b

def func2(a, b, c):
    print(b)
    return c + a

def func3(a, b, c):
    print("W"+b)
    return b + a

a = "X"
b = "Y"
c = "Z"
d = func1(b, c, a)
e = func2(d, a, b)
print(func3(a, e, func1(e, d, c)))
```

    Z
    Y
    XY
    X
    YZ
    YYZ
    ZYYZ
    WYYZ
    YYZX



```python
#2)
def alpha(x, y):
    return x + y

def beta(x):
    z = alpha(x, 3)
    return z**2

i = 4
print(beta(i))
```

    49



```python
#3)
def contribute(item):
    """Ask for person's contributions to something"""
    amount = float(input("How much did you contribute to "+item+"? "))
    return amount
    
def compute_deductions():
    """Calculate total deduction"""
    charity = contribute("charity")
    ira = contribute("a traditional IRA")
    itemized = charity + ira
    if itemized < 12550:
        itemized = 12550
    return itemized

def taxable(income, deductions):
    taxable = income - deductions
    return taxable

def main():
    income = float(input("How much did you earn? "))
    deductions = compute_deductions()
    net = taxable(income, deductions)
    print("Your taxable income is $"+str(net))

main()
```

    How much did you earn?  54500
    How much did you contribute to charity?  500
    How much did you contribute to a traditional IRA?  1000


    Your taxable income is $41950.0


Use inputs: `54000`, `500`, `1000`
