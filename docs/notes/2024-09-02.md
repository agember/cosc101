* First lab today or tomorrow

## Outline
* Warm-up
* Computational thinking
* Programming
* Hello, Python!
* Values

## Warm-up
What is an example of an algorithm you lookup and execute in real life?
(Recall: an algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that solve a problem.)

## Computational thinking

_Computational thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solution(s) in such a way that a computer—human or machine—can effectively carry out._ – Jeannette M. Wing

(_Wing is currently Director of the Data Science Institute at Columbia University and previously was Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Researcher and a Professor at Carnegie Mellon University_)
* Decomposition — break the problem into smaller sub-problems
* Pattern recognition — look for similarities with previously solved problems, across sub-problems, within sub-problems, etc.
* Abstraction — determine which details are important
* Algorithm design — create unambiguous step-by-step instructions
<!--* Example: How do I grow flowers?
* _Decomposition_
    * How do I prepare the soil?
    * How do I plant the seeds?
    * How do I care for the plants?
* _Pattern recognition_
    * Growing flowers is similar to growing vegetables
    * Repeat steps for each plant
    * Repeat care steps every day
* _Abstraction_
    * Assume pot is provided
    * Assume filling a water can is known
* _Algorithm — e.g., plant the seeds_
    1. How do I prepare the soil?
        1. Get an empty pot
        2. Fill the pot to the top with soil
    2. How do I plant the seeds? — steps for each seed:
        1. Make a hole that is 1 cm deep
        2. Place a seed in the hole
        3. Cover the seed with soil
    3. How do I care for the plants?
        1. Place the pot in the sun
        2. Water the plants daily
* Ambiguity — humans rely on contextual clues and experience; computers do _exactly_ what you tell them
    * Make a hole that is 1 cm deep does not specify the width
    * Cover the seed with soil does not specify how much soil
    * Water the plants daily does not specify how much water-->

0. Understanding the goal – direct a student to open lab hours
    1. _Go outside Bernstein Hall approximately 5 meters from the entrance you used to come into the building this morning._
    2. _Enter the building and go to room 333 (the computer lab where open lab hours will be held Sunday-Thursday 7pm-10pm)._
    3. _Note (mentally or on paper) any information that may be help you/us solve the problem._

<div style="height:10em;"></div>

1. Decomposition

* Initial decomposition
    1. Entering the building
    2. Getting to third floor
    3. Getting to room 333
* Futher decomposition
    1. Entering the building
        1. Getting to the door
        2. Getting inside
    2. Getting to the third floor
        1. Getting to the stairs (or elevator)
        2. Going up the stairs (or elevator)
    3. Getting to room 333
        1. Exiting the stairs (or elevator)
        2. Going down the hallway
        3. Entering the room

<div style="height:20em;"></div>

2. Pattern recognition

* Similarities between sub-problems
    * Getting to the door; getting to the stairs; going down the hallway
    * Getting inside; entering the room
* Similarities within subproblems
    * Getting to the door; getting to the stairs; going down the hallway – move forward and turn
* Similarities with previously solved problems
    * Getting to class today

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

3. Abstraction

* Does the person following directions know how to...
    * Move forward?
    * Open a door?
    * Climb stairs or use an elevator?
* What if you were programming a robot instead of providing directions to a human?

<div style="height:15em;"></div>

4. Algorithm design: _write step-by-step instructions_

<div style="height:35em;"></div>

5. Testing (**before next class**)
    1. _Give your instructions to someone who is not in this class. Ask them to follow the instructions. **Do not tell them the end goal!**_
    2. _Note where your instructions did not work as expected–e.g., the person went the wrong way._

## Programming
* _Recall: what is programming?_ — representing algorithms in a notation (language) that can be followed by a computer
* Natural language is inherently ambiguous
    * A robot could not follow our algorithm for getting to room 333
* Programming languages are unambiguous — an instruction has exactly one meaning	
* _What are the basic types of instructions used by Python (and nearly every programming language)?_
    * Receiving input — e.g., from keyboard
    * Providing output — e.g., display text on screen
    * Math and logic
    * Conditional execution
    * Repetition

## Hello Python
* Two modes of programming in Python
    * Type instructions into interpreter (console) — instructions are executed as they are entered
    * Type instructions in a file — instructions are executed when file is read by interpreter (run)
* First program


```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

    Hello, Python!


## Values

* Programs work with values (or objects)
* Different types (or classes) of objects
    * String — consist of letters, numbers, punctuation, or symbols; starts and ends with single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes
    * Integer — whole number
    * Float — decimal number

_Specify the data type for each of the following values:_

13346

_integer_

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

3.14159

_float_

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

 "Hamilton, NY"

_string_

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

'1819'

_string_

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

"XIII"

_string_

<div style="height:2em;"></div>

## Operators

* Used to compute new values
* Standard mathematical operations (integers or floats): add (`+`), subtract (`-`), multiply (`*`), divide (`/`)
* Other mathematical operations (integers or floats): integer division (`//`), modulo (`%`), exponent (`**`)
* Operations on strings: concatenation (`+`), repetition (`*`)

_Determine the result of each of the following expressions, or indicate if the expression is invalid:_


```python
3 + 4 + 6
```




    13



<div style="height:2em;"></div>


```python
(5 - 1) * (2.0 + 1)
```

<div style="height:2em;"></div>


```python
"New" + "York"
```




    'NewYork'
