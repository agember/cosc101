## Announcements
* Homework 2 due tomorrow at 5pm

## Warm-up
_What call to range would produce each of the following sequences of integers?_

\#1) `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

```Python

```

\#2) `[101, 102, 103, 104]`

```Python

```

\#3) `[15, 12, 9, 6]`

```Python

```

\#4) `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`

```Python

```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Accumulator pattern


_What is the output of the following programs? If necessary, provide input of your choosing._


```python
#1)
f = 1
for i in range(1, 4):
    f = f * i
print(f)
```

```
```


```python
#2)
word = input("Enter a word: ")
spell = ""
for c in word:
    spell += c + "-"
print(spell)
```

```

```


```python
#3)
greeting = "Hello "
for part in ['first','last']:
    name = input("What is your " + part + " name? ")
    greeting = greeting + name + " "
print(greeting)
```

```
```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP HERE** after completing the above problems; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Mapping patterns to loops

### Example


```python
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
dora = turtle.Turtle()
dora.left(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.right(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.left(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.right(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.left(90)
dora.forward(50)
dora.right(90)
dora.forward(50)
window.exitonclick()
```

### Practice
_Each of the following programs contains redundant code. Rewrite the program to use a loop and eliminate the redundancy._


```python
#1)
import random
die1 = random.randrange(0,6)
die2 = random.randrange(0,6)
die3 = random.randrange(0,6)
print("Die 1: " + str(die1))
print("Die 2: " + str(die2))
print("Die 3: " + str(die3))
```

```Python

```


```python
#2)
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
crush = turtle.Turtle()
crush.forward(10)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(20)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(30)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(40)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(50)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(60)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(70)
crush.right(90)
crush.forward(80)
crush.right(90)
window.exitonclick()
```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>


```python
#3)
import turtle
window = turtle.Screen()
ash = turtle.Turtle()
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(180)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
ash.left(120)
ash.forward(100)
window.exitonclick()
```

```Python



```


```python
#4)
print("1 is odd")
print("2 is even")
print("3 is odd")
print("4 is even")
print("5 is odd")
print("6 is even")
```

```Python



```

## Extra practice
\#1) _Write a program that asks a user how many steps they walked each day of the week and computes their step total for the week._

```Python





```
<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

\#2) _Write a program that asks for the dimensions of multiple rooms and computes the total square footage of a house or apartment._

```Python












```

\#3) _Write a program that flips a coin as many times as the user requested and outputs the percentage of flips that were heads._

```Python

















```

\#4) _Write a program that asks for ten positive numbers and outputs the largest number._
