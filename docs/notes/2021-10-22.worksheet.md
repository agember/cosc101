## Announcements
* Homework 6 due Thursday

## Outline
* Past/future of 101
* Using computational thinking and programming in other disciplines
* Future CS courses
* Homework 6 work time

## Past/future of 101
* Learned:
    * Fundamental building blocks of programs: variables, input/output, if statements, loops (for & while), functions, modules
    * How to decompose problems
    * How to decompose solutions and use solution patterns (input process-output, accumulator, sentinel, nested loops)
    * How to document and test code
* Second half of 101:
  * working with more/complex data
    * strings
    * lists
    * dictionaries
    * files
  * additional problem solving pattern: recursion

## Using computational thinking and programming in other disciplines
* Write programs to analyze many types of data
  * numbers
  * simple text
  * images
* In many domains
  * finance/economics/business
  * science
  * Healthcare
  * education
  * politics
* _How could you (have) use(d) computational thinking and programming in a course this semester or last year?_

## Future CS courses
* Introduction to Computing II (COSC 102)
    * New language: Java
    * Creating object classes
