_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-09-06_

## Announcements
* Homework 1 due Thursday at 11:59pm

## Outline
* Warm-up: input
* Errors

## Warm-up: input (from last class)

_Evaluate the following programs. If input is needed, provide your own. Indicate what output is produced or if an error occurs._


```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
count = len(name)
print("There are " + str(count) + " letters in your name.")
```

    What is your name?  Aaron


    There are 5 letters in your name.


<div style="height:5em;"></div>


```python
year = input("What year is it? ")
year = year + 1
print("Next year is", year)
```

    What year is it?  2024



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_2060/318286003.py in <module>
          1 year = input("What year is it? ")
    ----> 2 year = year + 1
          3 print("Next year is", year)


    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str


<div style="height:5em;"></div>


```python
human = input("How old are you? ")
dog = int(human) * 7
print("You are", dog, "years old in dog years")
```

    How old are you? 18
    You are 126 years old in dog years


<div style="height:5em;"></div>

_Write a program that asks a user for their name and age, and outputs: `<name> you donâ€™t look a day over <age - 1>`_


```python
name = input("What is your name ? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age) - 1
print(name, "you donâ€™t look a day over", age)
```

    What is your name ?  Joe Biden
    How old are you?  81


    Joe Biden you donâ€™t look a day over 80

## Errors

* Grace Hopper (an officer in the Navy) found a dead moth on a relay in one of the first computers (the Harvard Mark II) caused a problem, and the name bug stuck

![Photo of First Computer "Bug"](https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/t_edhub_resource_key_image/v1638888858/EducationHub/photos/computer-bug.jpg)

* Recall the three types of errors from the reading: syntax, runtime, and semantic

_What type of error exists in each of the following programs?_ 


```python
result = 6 - 7
print("six plus seven is...", result)
```

    six plus seven is... -1



Semantic â€” output is unexpected

<p style="height:3em;"></p>


```python
print("Lucky number 13"
```


      File "/var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_29667/3286650260.py", line 1
        print("Lucky number 13"
                               ^
    SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing



Syntax â€” missing parenthesis

<p style="height:3em;"></p>


```python
13 / 0
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

    ----> 1 13 / 0
    

    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero


Runtime â€” cannot divide by zero

<p style="height:3em;"></p>


```python
value = 13
print(value, "men offered $" + value , "and", value, "prayers")
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    Cell In[5], line 2
          1 value = 13
    ----> 2 print(value, "men offered $" + value , "and", value, "prayers")


    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str


Runtime â€” cannot add string and int

<p style="height:3em;"></p>


```python
print("What is your name?")
name = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

    What is your name?


    What is your name? Aaron


    Hello, Aaron



Semantic â€” double prompt

## Debugging

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

* Syntax errors
    1. Look at the line in the error output by the Python interpreter
    2. Look at the lines immediately before and after
* Runtime errors
    1. Look at the line in the error output by the Python interpreter
    2. Look at the line(s) that assigned a value to the variable used in the erroneous line
* Semantic errors
    1. Trace through the code by hand and draw a reference diagram
    2. Add print statements (remove when finished debugging) and compare the expected values with the actual values
    3. Try different inputs

_The following program is supposed to ask the user for a weight in kilograms and provide the weight in pounds and ouncesâ€“e.g., if the user enters `6.5` the program should output `14 lbs 5 oz`. There are approximately 2.205 pounds in 1 kilogram, and exactly 16 ounces in 1 pound. Find and fix the errors so the program works properly._


```python

kilograms = input("Weight in kilograms: ")

pounds = kilograms * 2.205

ounces = int(pounds % 1 * 16)

pounds = int(pounds)

print(pounds + "lbs" + ounces + "oz")

```

<p style="height:10em;"></p>

* Need to convert input to `float`
* Need to convert `pounds` and `ounces` to strings in `print`
* Need to add spaces in `"lbs"` and `"oz"` strings in `print`


```python
kilograms = float(input("Weight in kilograms: "))
pounds = kilograms * 2.205
ounces = int(pounds % 1 * 16)
pounds = int(pounds)
print(pounds, "lbs", ounces, "oz")
```

    Weight in kilograms:  6.5


    14 lbs 5 oz


_The following program is supposed to ask the user for a distance in meters and provide the distance in feet and inchesâ€“e.g., if the user enters `1.68` the program should output `5'6"`. There are approximately 3.281 feet in 1 meter, and exactly 12 inches in 1 foot. A single quote (`'`) is an abbreviation for feet, and and a double quote (`"`) is an abbreviation for inches. Find and fix the errors so the program works properly._


```python

meters = float(input("Distance in meters: "))

feet = int(meters * 3.281)

inches = int(feet % 1 * 12)

print(str(feet) + "'" + str(inches) + """)

```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

* Need to save fractional feet before converting `feet` to an integer
* Need to use single quotes (`'`) around the double quote (`"`) signifying inches


```python
meters = float(input("Distance in meters: "))
feet = meters * 3.281
inches = int(feet % 1 * 12)
feet = int(feet)
print(str(feet) + "'" + str(inches) + '"')
```

    Distance in meters:  1.68


    5'6"


_The following program is supposed to print a recipe for making cupcakes. Find and fix the errors so the program works properly._


```python

dozen = print("How many dozen cupcakes do you want?")

print("Ingredients:")

print("*", int(dozen), "cups flour")

print("*", int(dozen) * 1//4, "tsp salt")

print("*", int(dozen), "tsp baking powder")

print("*", int(dozen) * 1//4, "cups butter")

print("*", int(dozen) * 3//8, "cups sugar")

print("*", int(dozen), "eggs")

print("*", int(dozen) * 1//2, "cups milk")

print("Directions:")

print("1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.")

print("2. Put liners in" + str(int(dozen) * 12) + "muffin cups.")

print("3. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.")

print("4. Combine flour", "salt", "and baking soda.")

print("5. Add flour mixture and milk to butter and sugar; beat well.")

print("6. Divide batter evenly among" + str(int(dozen) * 12) + "muffin cups.")

print("7. Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans.")

```

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

* Call `input` not `print` to get desired number of cupcakes
* Convert `dozen` to an integer once, before performing any calculations
* Use regular division (`/`) not integer division (`//`) for fractions
* Add spaces in strings before and after count of muffin cups
* Put commas in string in step 3, not between strings


```python
dozen = int(input("How many dozen cupcakes do you want?"))
print("Ingredients:")
print("*", dozen, "cups flour")
print("*", dozen * 1/4, "tsp salt")
print("*", dozen, "tsp baking powder")
print("*", dozen * 1/4, "cups butter")
print("*", dozen * 3/8, "cups sugar")
print("*", dozen, "eggs")
print("*", dozen * 1/2, "cups milk")
print("Directions:")
print("1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.")
print("2. Put liners in " + str(dozen * 12) + " muffin cups.")
print("3. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.")
print("4. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda.")
print("5. Add flour mixture and milk to butter and sugar; beat well.")
print("6. Divide batter evenly among" + str(dozen * 12) + "muffin cups.")
print("7. Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans.")
```

_The heat index quantifies how hot it feels outside based on the temperature and humidity. The following program is supposed to ask for the user for the temperature (in Farenheit) and relative humidity (as a percentage) and provide the heat temperature in celsius and the heat index in farenheit and celsius, rounded to one decimal place. Find and fix the errors so the program works properly. The relevant mathematical formulas are listed below to help you debug the code._
* Formula for computing the heat index (`HI`) in Farenheit based on the temperature (`T`) in Farenheight and the relative humidity (`RH`) in percent: `HI = -42.379 + 2.04901523*T + 10.14333127*RH - .22475541*T*RH - .00683783*TÂ² - .05481717*RHÂ² + .00122874*TÂ²*RH + .00085282*T*RHÂ² - .00000199*TÂ²*RHÂ²`
* Formula for converting a temperature in farenheit (`F`) to celsius (`C`): `C = (F - 32) * 5/9`
* Formula for converting a temperature in celsius (`C`) to farenheit (`F`): `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`


```python

temperature = int(input("What is the temperature (in Â°F)? "))

humidity = int(input("What is the relative humidity? "))

temperature = (temperature * 9/5) + 32

print("Temperature: " + str(temperature) + "Â°C")

heat_index_F = -42.379 + 2.04901523*T + 10.14333127*RH

heat_index_F = heat_index_F - .22475541*T*RH - .00683783*TÂ² - .05481717*RHÂ²

heat_index_F = heat_index_F + .00122874*TÂ²*RH  + .00085282*T*RHÂ² - .00000199*TÂ²*RHÂ²

heat_index_C = (temperature - 32) * 5/9

print("Heat index: " + str(round(heat_index_F, 1)) + "Â°F")

print(" / " + str(round(heat_index_C, 1)) + "Â°C")

```

<p style="height:10em;"></p>


```python
temperature_F = int(input("What is the temperature (in Â°F)? "))
humidity = int(input("What is the relative humidity? "))
temperature_C = (temperature_F - 32) * 5/9
print("Temperature: " + str(round(temperature_C, 1)) + "Â°C")
heat_index_F = -42.379 + 2.04901523*temperature_F + 10.14333127*humidity
heat_index_F = heat_index_F - .22475541*temperature_F*humidity - .00683783*temperature_F**2 - .05481717*humidity**2 
heat_index_F = heat_index_F + .00122874*temperature_F**2*humidity  + .00085282*temperature_F*humidity**2 - .00000199*temperature_F**2*humidity**2
heat_index_C = (heat_index_F - 32) * 5/9
print("Heat index: " + str(round(heat_index_F, 1)) + "Â°F / " + str(round(heat_index_C, 1)) + "Â°C")
```

    What is the temperature (in Â°F)?  90
    What is the relative humidity?  60


    Temperature: 32.2Â°C
    Heat index: 99.7Â°F / 37.6Â°C


## Recall: computational thinking

* Recall that patterns and abstraction are two important parts of computational thinking
    * _How do these apply to our cupcake recipe program?_


```python
dozen = int(input("How many dozen cupcakes do you want?"))
print("Ingredients:")
print("*", dozen, "cups flour")
print("*", dozen * 1/4, "tsp salt")
print("*", dozen, "tsp baking powder")
print("*", dozen * 1/4, "cups butter")
print("*", dozen * 3/8, "cups sugar")
print("*", dozen, "eggs")
print("*", dozen * 1/2, "cups milk")
print("Directions:")
print("1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.")
print("2. Put liners in " + str(dozen * 12) + " muffin cups.")
print("3. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.")
print("4. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda.")
print("5. Add flour mixture and milk to butter and sugar; beat well.")
print("6. Divide batter evenly among" + str(dozen * 12) + "muffin cups.")
print("7. Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans.")
```

* We should divide our code into pieces, just like we divide the problem into pieces
    * Start by adding some blank lines to separate sections of the code


```python
dozen = int(input("How many dozen cupcakes do you want?"))

print("Ingredients:")
print("*", dozen, "cups flour")
print("*", dozen * 1/4, "tsp salt")
print("*", dozen, "tsp baking powder")
print("*", dozen * 1/4, "cups butter")
print("*", dozen * 3/8, "cups sugar")
print("*", dozen, "eggs")
print("*", dozen * 1/2, "cups milk")

print("Directions:")
print("1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.")
print("2. Put liners in " + str(dozen * 12) + " muffin cups.")
print("3. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.")
print("4. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda.")
print("5. Add flour mixture and milk to butter and sugar; beat well.")
print("6. Divide batter evenly among" + str(dozen * 12) + "muffin cups.")
print("7. Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans.")
```

## Functions

* Group related lines into functions
* Recall from the reading: _how do we create our own function?_


```python
def function_name():
    # Lines of code, indentded
```

* Let's modify our cupcake program to include functions


```python
dozen = int(input("How many dozen cupcakes do you want?"))

def ingredients():
    print("Ingredients:")
    print("*", dozen, "cups flour")
    print("*", dozen * 1/4, "tsp salt")
    print("*", dozen, "tsp baking powder")
    print("*", dozen * 1/4, "cups butter")
    print("*", dozen * 3/8, "cups sugar")
    print("*", dozen, "eggs")
    print("*", dozen * 1/2, "cups milk")

def directions():
    print("Directions:")
    print("1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.")
    print("2. Put liners in " + str(dozen * 12) + " muffin cups.")
    print("3. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.")
    print("4. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda.")
    print("5. Add flour mixture and milk to butter and sugar; beat well.")
    print("6. Divide batter evenly among" + str(dozen * 12) + "muffin cups.")
    print("7. Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans.")
```

    How many dozen cupcakes do you want? 2


* _Why does our program no longer print the ingredients and directions?_ â€“ need to call the functions!


```python
dozen = int(input("How many dozen cupcakes do you want?"))
ingredients()
directions()

def ingredients():
    print("Ingredients:")
    print("*", dozen, "cups flour")
    print("*", dozen * 1/4, "tsp salt")
    print("*", dozen, "tsp baking powder")
    print("*", dozen * 1/4, "cups butter")
    print("*", dozen * 3/8, "cups sugar")
    print("*", dozen, "eggs")
    print("*", dozen * 1/2, "cups milk")

def directions():
    print("Directions:")
    print("1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.")
    print("2. Put liners in " + str(dozen * 12) + " muffin cups.")
    print("3. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.")
    print("4. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda.")
    print("5. Add flour mixture and milk to butter and sugar; beat well.")
    print("6. Divide batter evenly among" + str(dozen * 12) + "muffin cups.")
    print("7. Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans.")
```

* _Why we receive an error that `ingredients` is not defined?_ â€“ function must be declared before it is used
* _Where does the program start executing?_ - with call to `input`, but it's hard to find this point
    * Add a function called `main`, which is where the program starts
    * Still need a call to `main` at the very end of the file


```python
def ingredients():
    print("Ingredients:")
    print("*", dozen, "cups flour")
    print("*", dozen * 1/4, "tsp salt")
    print("*", dozen, "tsp baking powder")
    print("*", dozen * 1/4, "cups butter")
    print("*", dozen * 3/8, "cups sugar")
    print("*", dozen, "eggs")
    print("*", dozen * 1/2, "cups milk")

def directions():
    print("Directions:")
    print("1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.")
    print("2. Put liners in " + str(dozen * 12) + " muffin cups.")
    print("3. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.")
    print("4. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda.")
    print("5. Add flour mixture and milk to butter and sugar; beat well.")
    print("6. Divide batter evenly among" + str(dozen * 12) + "muffin cups.")
    print("7. Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in pans.")

def main():
    dozen = int(input("How many dozen cupcakes do you want?"))
    ingredients()
    directions()

main()
```

* _Why we receive an error that `dozen` is not defined?_ â€“ variables only exist in the function in which a value is assigned to them
* Next time: using parameters to pass a value from one function to another

## Extra practice

_Write a program that asks the user for the hour (according to a 24-hour clock) they went to bed and the hour they woke up and tells them how many hours they slept._


```python
bed = int(input("At what hour did you go to bed?"))
wakeup = int(input("At what hour did you wakeup?"))
slept = 24 - bed + wakeup
print("You slept for " + str(slept) + " hours")
```

    At what hour did you go to bed? 21
    At what hour did you wakeup? 5


    You slept for 8 hours
