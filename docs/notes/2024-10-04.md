## Warm-up

_Draw a flowchart for the following program:_


```python
day = input("Today is ")
if (day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday"):
    print("It is the weekend")
else:
    print("It is a weekday")
if (day == "Wednesday"):
    print("Halfway to the weekend")
print("Happy " + day + "!")
```

```







```

_What will the program output if a user enters `Saturday`?_

```
Today is Saturday
It is the weekend
Happy Saturday!
```

```



```

_What will the program output if a user enters `Monday`?_

```
Today is Monday
It is a weekday
Happy Monday!
```

```



```

_What will the program output if a user enters `Wednesday`?_

```
Today is Wednesday
It is a weekday
Happy Wednesday!
Halfway to the weekend
```

```



```
ðŸ›‘ **STOP here** after completing the above questions; if you have extra time **skip** to the extra practice.

## Boolean operators

* Used to combine two boolean values (or expressions) into a single boolean value
    * `and` â€“ `True` if **both** boolean values are `True`, otherwise `False`
    * `or` â€“ `True` if **either** boolean value is `True`, otherwise `False`
* `not` â€“ inverts a boolean value (or expression)

```



```

_Assume the following assignment statements have been executed:_


```python
x = -2
y = 0
z = 5
```

_What does each of the following boolean expressions evaluate to? If the expression is an invalid boolean expression, describe why._


```python
x < 0 and y < 0
```




    False




```python
z > 3 and z < 7
```




    True




```python
y not == 0
```


      Cell In[5], line 1
        y not == 0
              ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax




```python
x < y or (z >= 0 and y <= 5)
```




    True

## if/elif/else

_Example_


```python
day = int(input("Day? "))
if day <= 7:
    print("1st week")
elif day > 7 and day <= 14:
    print("2nd week")
else:
    print("Beyond")
print("End")
```

_Write a program that asks for the number of hours an employee works each week and outputs whether they work full-time (40 or more hours), half-time (exactly 20 hours) or part-time (less than 40 hours, but not exactly 20 hours)._


```python
def main() -> None:
    hours = int(input("How many hours do you work each week? "))
    if (hours >= 40):
        print("You work full-time")
    elif (hours == 20):
        print("You work half-time")
    else:
        print("You work part-time")
main()
```

    How many hours do you work each week?  35


    You work part-time


```










```

_For the following program, which code blocks will be executed when the listed conditions are true?_

```Python
if condition 1:
    code block A
if condition 2:
    code block B
elif condition 3:
    code block C
else:
    code block D
```

_When conditions 1 and 2 are True_

A, B

_When conditions 2 and 3 are True_

B

_When only condition 1 is True_

A, D

_For the following program, which code blocks will be executed when `num` is assigned the following values?_

```Python
if num < 10:
    code block A
elif num > 10:
    code block B
else:
    code block C
if num > 5 and num < 10:
    code block D
elif num < 5 or num > 10:
    code block E
elif num == 10:
    code block F
```

_When `num` is `7`_

A, D

_When `num` is `10`_

C, F

_When `num` is `15`_

B, E

_When `num` is `5`_

A

_Write a program that asks for a number and outputs, "lesser" if the number is divisible by three, "greater" if the number is divisible by five, and "double" if the number is disivible by three and five._


```python
def main() -> None:
    num = int(input("Number: "))
    if (num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0):
        print("double")
    elif (num % 3 == 0):
        print("lesser")
    elif (num % 5 == 0):
        print("greater")
main()
```

    Number:  10


    greater


```










```

## Extra practice

 _Write a program that asks for a person's age and outputs whether they are a minor (under 18), an adult (18 or older), and/or a teenager (age 13 through 19)._


```python
def main() -> None:
    age = int(input("How old are you? "))
    if (age < 18):
        print("You are a minor")
    else:
        print("You are an adult")
    if (age >= 13 and age <= 19):
        print("You are a teenager")
main()
```

    How old are you?  37


    You are an adult


```









```

_What is the output of each of the following programs?_


```python
def main() -> None:
    print("True or True is", True or True)
    print("True or False is", True or False)
    print("False or True is", False or True)
    print("False or False is", False or False)
main()
```

    True or True is True
    True or False is True
    False or True is True
    False or False is False


```




```


```python
def main() -> None:
    print("True and True is", True and True)
    print("True and False is", True and False)
    print("False and True is", False and True)
    print("False and False is", False and False)
main()
```

    True and True is True
    True and False is False
    False and True is False
    False and False is False
