# Debugging (continued); modules; function calls; objects
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2021-09-10_

## Announcements
* Homework 2 due Thursday at 5pm

## Warm-up
_Write a program that asks for yesterday‚Äôs and today‚Äôs high temperatures and outputs `Today is warmer`, `Today is colder`, or `Today is the same`._

```Python









```
üõë **STOP HERE** after completing the warm-up; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Modules

\#1) _Write your own TSA pseudo-randomizer app. Hint: Use the `randint` function from the `random` module; `randint` requires two parameters‚Äîa minimum and maximum integer‚Äîand generates a random integer that is greater than or equal to the minimum and less than or equal to the maximum._

```Python









```

\#2) _Write a program that asks for the number of sides on a die and ‚Äúrolls‚Äù the die._

```Python










```
üõë **STOP HERE** after completing the above questions; please **DO NOT WORK AHEAD**. If you have extra time, work on the extra practice problems at the end of the worksheet.

## Turtle graphics

\#1) _Write a program that draws the number 2 (like on a digital clock)._

```Python

















```

\#2) _Write a program that draws a simple house._

```

## Extra practice
\#1) _Write a program that asks for the length of the sides of a right triangle and computes the length of the hypotenuse. Hint: You‚Äôll need to use the Pythagorean theorem (a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤) and the `sqrt` function in the `math` module._

```Python






```

\#2) _Write a program that asks for the length of the hpotenuse and one side of a right triangle and computes the angle opposite the side in radians. Hint: You‚Äôll need to use the law of sines (a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C) and the `sin` and `asin` functions (which work with radians, not degrees) and the `pi` constant in the `math` module._

```Python










```

\#3) _Write a program that asks for the length of the sides of a right triangle and draws the corresponding triangle. Hint: You‚Äôll need to reuse some of your code from the above programs, along with the `degrees` function in the `math` module to convert radians to degrees._

```Python



























```

\#4) _Write a program that draws the Big Dipper constellation_
