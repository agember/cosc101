# Iteration: strings and lists
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-09-18_

## Announcements
* Homework 2 due tomorrow at 11:59pm

## Collections

* _What are the three types of values we have seen/used in programs thus far?_ – int, float, string
* Regardless of the number of digits in an integer, we treat it as a single value – e.g., `7`, `99`, `1819`
    * Similarly for floats
    * Similarly for strings – e.g., `"awesome"`, `"How are you?"`, `"13"`
* However, a string is actually a collection of "smaller" values – individual characters
    * e.g., `"awesome"` is the sequence of characters a, w, e, s, o, m, e
    * `"a" + "w" + "e" + "s" + "o" + "m" + "e"` evaluates to "awesome"
    * We cannot think of integers, or floats, as a collection of values, because they don't combine in the same way – e.g., `9 + 9` evalutes to `18` not `99`

## String indexing

* Characters are numbered left to right starting from 0
    ```
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
    ┏━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┓
    ┃ C ┃ o ┃ l ┃ g ┃ a ┃ t ┃ e ┃   ┃ 1 ┃ 3 ┃
    ┗━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┛
    ```
* To access a specific character: use the string name followed by the character number (or index) in square brackets (`[]`)


```python
myString = 'Colgate 13'
print(myString[0])
print(myString[1])
print(myString[4])
```

    C
    o
    a


* Can also use negative numbers (starting at `-1`) to get a character relative to the end of the string


```python
print(myString[-1])
print(myString[-4])
```

    3
    e


```





```

_For each of the following programs, fill-in the blanks such that the program produces the expected output._


```python
full = "New York"
abbreviation = full[-___] + full[-___]
print(abbreviation)
```

Expected output:
```
NY
```


```python
full = "New York"
abbreviation = full[-8] + full[-4]
print(abbreviation)
```

    NY



```python
name = "Ruth Bader Ginsburg"
initials = name[___] + name[___] + name[___]
print(initials)
initials = initials[___] + "." + initials[___] + "." + initials[___]
print(initials)
```

Expected output:
```
RBG
R.B.G.
```


```python
name = "Ruth Bader Ginsburg"
initials = name[0] + name[5] + name[11]
print(initials)
initials = initials[0] + "." + initials[1] + "." + initials[2]
print(initials)
```

    RBG
    R.B.G


🛑 **STOP here** after filling in the blanks; if you have extra time **skip** to the extra practice.

## Lists

* Sequential collection of any type of values (e.g., int, float, string)
    * List may contain multiple types of values
    * List may even include another list — called a sublist
* Create a list using square brackets


```python
list1 = [10, 20, 'aniyah', 'bilal']
list2 = [] # empty list
list3 = ['carlos', [50, 60]]
```

* Each item in the list has an index — just like strings
    * The first (i.e., leftmost) item has index 0
    * Use negative indices to refer to items starting from the last (i.e., rightmost) item
    * Use the slice operator to access a subset of the items in the list

<div style="page-break-after:always;"></div>

_What does the following code ouput? If a particular print statement causes an error, describe what is wrong with that statement; assume subsequent print statements still execute._


```python
v = [13, 42, 99]
w = [3, "plus", 5, "equals", 8]
x = [3 + 5, "=8"]
y = []

print('a)', len(v))

print('b)', len(w))

print('c)', len(x))

print('d)', len(y))

print('e)', v[1])

print('f)', y[0])
```

    a) 3
    b) 5
    c) 2
    d) 0
    e) 42



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    Cell In[6], line 16
         12 print('d)', len(y))
         14 print('e)', v[1])
    ---> 16 print('f)', y[0])


    IndexError: list index out of range



```python
print('g)', w[-2])

print('h)', x[0])

print('i)', v[3])
```

    g) equals
    h) 8



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    Cell In[11], line 5
          1 print('g)', w[-2])
          3 print('h)', x[0])
    ----> 5 print('h)', v[3])


    IndexError: list index out of range



```python
print('j)', x[1][1])

print('k)', w[1][0])

print('l)', len(w[1]))
```

    j) 8
    k) p
    l) 4


## Extra practice

_Fill-in the blanks such that the program produces the expected output._


```python
phrase1 = "Let it go, "
phrase2 = "Can't hold it back anymore."
print(__________ * __________ + __________)
phrase3 = "Turn away and slam the door."
print(__________ * __________ + __________)
print("~Elsa from Frozen")
```

Expected output:
```
Let it go, Let it go, Can't hold it back anymore.
Let it go, Let it go, Turn away and slam the door.
~Elsa from Frozen
```


```python
phrase1 = "Let it go, "
phrase2 = "Can't hold it back anymore."
print(phrase1 * 2 + phrase2)
phrase3 = "Turn away and slam the door."
print(phrase1 * 2 + phrase3)
print("~Elsa from Frozen")
```

    Let it go, Let it go, Can't hold it back anymore.
    Let it go, Let it go, Turn away and slam the door.
    ~Elsa from Frozen
