# Files: reading
_COSC 101, Introduction to Computing I, 2024-11-04_

## Announcements

* Exam 2 reattempts Friday during class

## Accessing files

_Assume the file `myfile.txt` contains the following data:_
```
First line
Second line
Third line
```


```python
# Create a file for testing
with open('myfile.txt', 'w') as myfile:
    myfile.write('First line\nSecond line\nThird line')
```

* Files can contain many different types of data—text, image, video, audio, source code, etc.
    * Same type of data may also be stored in different formats—e.g., audio may be encoded as mp3, aac, etc.
* _What does a program need to do before it can read data from a file?_ — open the file for reading
    * `open` takes filepath and mode (`'r'` for read or `'w'` for write) as arguments; returns file object


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
```

* _What does a program need to do when it is done reading data from file?_ — close the file


```python
myfile.close()
```

## Reading files

* Read every line of the file, one line at a time — use a for loop


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
for line in myfile:
    print(line)
myfile.close()
```

    First line
    
    Second line
    
    Third line


* Read one line at a time — use the `readline` function
    * The next call to `readline` returns the next line of the file
    * If the file is closed and then opened again, the next call to `readline` will start at the beginning of the file
     * When the end of the file is reached, `readline` returns the empty string (`""`)


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
line1 = myfile.readline()
line2 = myfile.readline()
myfile.close()
print(line1)
print(line2)

myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
line1again = myfile.readline()
myfile.close()
print(line1again)
```

    First line
    
    Second line
    
    First line
    


* Read all lines of the file into a list of strings — use the `readlines` function


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
list_of_lines = myfile.readlines()
myfile.close()
print(list_of_lines)
```

    ['First line\n', 'Second line\n', 'Third line']


* Read the entire file into a string — use the `read` function


```python
myfile = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
entire_file = myfile.read()
myfile.close()
print(entire_file)
```

    First line
    Second line
    Third line


* Strings include the newline character (`'\n'`)
    * Remove newline using the `strip` function


```python
line1 = line1.strip()
line2 = line2.strip()
print(line1)
print(line2)
```

    First line
    Second line

_Assume the file `flowers.txt` contains the following data:_
```
Rose
Tulip
Daisy
```


```python
# Run this code cell to create flowers.txt
with open('flowers.txt', 'w') as flowers:
    flowers.write('Rose\nTulip\nDaisy\n')
```

*What is the output of each of the following programs?*


```python
def main() -> None:
    flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
    data = flowers.readline()
    print(len(data))
    print("#"+str(data)+"#")
    flowers.close()
main()
```

    #Rose
    #

```python
def main() -> None:
    flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
    for data in flowers:
        data = data.strip()
        print(len(data))
        print("#"+str(data)+"#")
    flowers.close()
main()
```

    #Rose#

    #Tulip#

    #Daisy#

```python
def main() -> None:
    flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
    data = flowers.read()
    data = data.strip()
    print(len(data))
    print("#"+str(data)+"#")
    flowers.close()
main()
```

```python
def main() -> None:
    flowers = open('flowers.txt', 'r')
    data = flowers.readlines()
    print(len(data))
    print("#"+str(data)+"#")
    flowers.close()
main()
```

## Extra practice

_Write a function called `split_name` that takes a single string containing a person's last name and first name, separated by a comma, and returns a list containing the person's first name and last name, in that order. For example `split_name('Gember-Jacobson, Aaron')` should return `['Aaron', 'Gember-Jacobson']`._


```python
def split_name(name):
    '''
    Converts a person's name written as 'Last, First' into a list of names ['First', 'Last']
    >>> split_name('Gember-Jacobson, Aaron')
    ['Aaron', 'Gember-Jacobson']
    '''
    parts = name.split(', ')
    names = [parts[1], parts[0]]
    return names
```

```
