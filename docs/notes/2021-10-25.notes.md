* string slicing
* Programmatic poetry

## Warm-up
_For each of the following programs, fill-in the blanks such that the program produces the expected output._


```python
#1)
phrase1 = "Let it go, "
phrase2 = "Can't hold it back anymore."
print(__________ * __________ + __________)
phrase3 = "Turn away and slam the door."
print(__________ * __________ + __________)
print("~Elsa from Frozen")
```

Expected output:
```
Let it go, Let it go, Can't hold it back anymore.
Let it go, Let it go, Turn away and slam the door.
~Elsa from Frozen
```


```python
phrase1 = "Let it go, "
phrase2 = "Can't hold it back anymore."
print(phrase1 * 2 + phrase2)
phrase3 = "Turn away and slam the door."
print(phrase1 * 2 + phrase3)
print("~Elsa from Frozen")
```

    Let it go, Let it go, Can't hold it back anymore.
    Let it go, Let it go, Turn away and slam the door.
    ~Elsa from Frozen



```python
#2)
suffix = "ice"
for __________________________________:
    print(__________ + suffix)
```

Expected output:
```
dice
rice
slice
twice
```


```python
suffix = "ice"
for prefix in ['d', 'r', 'sl', 'tw']:
    print(prefix + suffix)
```

    dice
    rice
    slice
    twice


## Strings
Already know how to…
* Represent a string — surround sequence of characters with single (`'`), double (`"`), triple-single (`'''`), or triple-double (`"""`) quotes
* Concatenate strings — using `+` operator
* Repeat strings — using `*` operator
* Count the number of characters — using `len` function

## String indexing

### Overview
* Characters are numbered left to right starting from 0
    ```
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
    ┏━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┳━━━┓
    ┃ C ┃ o ┃ l ┃ g ┃ a ┃ t ┃ e ┃   ┃ 1 ┃ 3 ┃
    ┗━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┻━━━┛
    ```
* To access a specific character: use the string name followed by the character number (or index) in square brackets (`[]`)


```python
myString = 'Colgate 13'
print(myString[0])
print(myString[1])
print(myString[4])
```

    C
    o
    a


* Can also use negative numbers (starting at `-1`) to get a character relative to the end of the string


```python
print(myString[-1])
print(myString[-4])
```

    3
    e


### Practice

_For each of the following programs, fill-in the blanks such that the program produces the expected output._


```python
#1)
name = "Ruth Bader Ginsburg"
initials = name[___] + name[___] + name[___]
print(initials)
result = __________
for letter in initials:
    result += __________ + __________
print(result)
```

Expected output:
```
RBG
R.B.G.
```


```python
name = "Ruth Bader Ginsburg"
initials = name[0] + name[5] + name[11]
print(initials)
result = ""
for letter in initials:
    result += letter + "."
print(result)
```

    RBG
    R.B.G.



```python
#2)
full = "New York"
abbreviation = full[-___] + full[-___]
print(abbreviation)
```

Expected output:
```
NY
```


```python
full = "New York"
abbreviation = full[-8] + full[-4]
print(abbreviation)
```

    NY


## String slicing

### Overview
* Used to select a contiguous subset of characters in a string
* Put starting and ending indices in square brackets separated by a colon
    * Includes character at starting index, but excludes character at ending index—similar to sequence generated by `range` going to `STOP-1`


```python
print(myString[0:7])
print(myString[8:10])
```

    Colgate
    13


* _What happens if you exclude the starting index?_ —slice starts at the beginning of the string


```python
print(myString[:3])
```

    Col


* _What happens if you exclude the ending index?_ —slice stops at the end of the string


```python
print(myString[8:])
```

    13


### Practice

_For each of the following programs, fill-in the blanks such that the program produces the expected output._


```python
#1)
line1 = "You may write me down in history"
print(line1)
line2 = "W" + line1[___:___] + line1[-___] + " your bitter, twisted lies,"
print(line2)
line3 = line1[:___] + "trod me" + line1[-___:-___] + "the very dirt"
print(line3)
line4 = "But still" + line2[___] + " like dust" + line2[___] + " I'll rise."
print(line4)
print("~Maya Angelou")
```

Expected output:
```
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.
~Maya Angelou
```


```python
line1 = "You may write me down in history"
print(line1)
line2 = "W" + line1[10:12] + line1[-7] + " your bitter, twisted lies,"
print(line2)
line3 = line1[:8] + "trod me" + line1[-11:-7] + "the very dirt"
print(line3)
line4 = "But still" + line2[-1] + " like dust" + line2[-1] + " I'll rise."
print(line4)
print("~Maya Angelou")
```

    You may write me down in history
    With your bitter, twisted lies,
    You may trod me in the very dirt
    But still, like dust, I'll rise.
    ~Maya Angelou



```python
#2)
sport = 'figure skating'
print(sport[___:___])
print(sport[:___])
print(sport[___] + sport[___:])
print(sport[-___:-___])
```

Expected output:
```
tin
figure
king
kat
```


```python
sport = 'figure skating'
print(sport[10:13])
print(sport[:6])
print(sport[8] + sport[11:])
print(sport[-6:-3])
```

    tin
    figure
    king
    kat



```python
#3)
line1 = "When the light is gr" + "e" * ___ + "n you go."
print(line1)
line2 = line1[:___] + "red" + line1[-___:-___] + "stop."
print(line2)
print("But what do you do")
line4 = line2[:___] + "turns blue"
print(line4)
print("With orange and lavender spots?")
print("~Shel Silverstein")
```

Expected output:
```
When the light is green you go.
When the light is red you stop.
But what do you do
When the light turns blue
With orange and lavender spots?
~Shel Silverstein
```


```python
line1 = "When the light is gr" + "e" * 2 + "n you go."
print(line1)
line2 = line1[:18] + "red" + line1[-8:-3] + "stop."
print(line2)
print("But what do you do")
line4 = line2[:15] + "turns blue"
print(line4)
print("With orange and lavender spots?")
print("~Shel Silverstein")
```

    When the light is green you go.
    When the light is red you stop.
    But what do you do
    When the light turns blue
    With orange and lavender spots?
    ~Shel Silverstein


## Programmatic poetry
_Write a program that outputs part of a poem or song lyrics. Your program **must** use string:_
* Concatenation
* Repetition
* Indexing
* Slicing
