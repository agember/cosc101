## Warm-up
_Label each of the following in the program below:_
1. Function body
2. Function call
3. Function definition
4. Argument (or actual parameter)
5. Parameter (or formal parameter)


```python
def update(x):    # Function definition; Parameter x
    if (x < 0):   # Function body
        x = x + 1 # Function body
    elif (x > 0): # Function body
        x = x - 1 # Function body

a = 5 
update(a)         # Function call; Argument a
print(a)          # Function call; Argument a
```

## Scope

### Overview
* Recall:
    * Parameter (or formal parameter) — listed in function definition; akin to left-hand-side of assignment statement
    * Argument (or actual parameter) — listed in function call; akin to right-hand-side of assignment statement
* Local variables and parameters
    * Defined (i.e., first assigned a value) in function
    * Only exists in the function in which a value is assigned to it
    * Name and value goes away when function finishes → variable is inaccessible outside of the function
* Global variables
    * Defined outside of a function
    * Can be accessed but not updated inside a function

### Example


```python
def demoFn():
    varLocal = 3 # Defines local variable called varLocal
    print(varLocal) # Can access local variable varLocal within function
    print(varGlobal1) # Can access global variable varGlobal within function
    varGlobal2 = 4 # Defines new local variable called varGlobal2
    print(varGlobal2) # Can access local variable varGlobal2 within function

varGlobal1 = 1 # Define global variable called varGlobal1
varGlobal2 = 2 # Define global variable called varGlobal2
demoFn()
print(varGlobal2) # Will still have value 10
print(varLocal) # Cannot access local variable varLocal outside of function
```

    /var/folders/bd/35sz70xs5837wszrx11bw1yc0000gn/T/ipykernel_29002/1034276298.py in <module>
         10 demoFn()
         11 print(varGlobal2) # Will still have value 10
    ---> 12 print(varLocal) # Cannot access local variable varLocal outside of function

    print(x * y)

x = 4
y = 2
multiply()
```

    return y

y = 10
z = decrement(y)
print(y,z)
```

## Return values

### Overview
* Return value — result provided by the function
    * Not the same as printing out the result!
* _How do we make a function return a value?_ — add a return statement with the value to return
* What does the caller do with the return value?
    * Assign it to a variable
    * Print it
    * Use it as an operand
 
### Practice

_What is the output of each of the following programs?_


```python
#1)
def magic(a):
    return a * 2

x = 5
print("x was " + str(x))
x = magic(x)
print("now it is " + str(x))
```

    x was 5
    now it is 10



```python
#2)
def compute_exam_average(exam1, exam2, exam3):
    total = exam1 + exam2 + exam3
    average = total / 3
    return average

def convert_to_letter(grade):
    if grade >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif grade >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif grade >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif grade >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

percent = compute_exam_average(75, 85, 80)
letter = convert_to_letter(percent)
print("Exam grade:", letter, str(percent) + "%")
```

    Exam grade: B 80.0%


## Modular programming

* Previous program demonstrates modular programming
    * Recall: decomposition (breaking a problem into sub-problems) is the first step of computational thinking
    * Recall: a good programming practice is to decompose the solution and implement one step at a time
* Modular programming also enables code reuse


```python
def compute_homework_average(hw1, hw2, hw3, hw4, hw5):
    total = hw1 + hw2 + hw3 + hw4 + hw5
    average = total / 5
    return average

percent = compute_homework_average(95, 90, 93, 87, 95)
letter = convert_to_letter(percent)
print("Homework grade:", letter, str(percent) + "%")
```

    Homework grade: A 92.0%


### Practice

_Convert each of the following programs into a modular version with at least one function_


```python
#1)
standard_wall_height = 10

# Calculate square feet of wall space in offices
office_short_wall = standard_wall_height * 8
office_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 12
per_office = 2 * office_short_wall + 2 * office_long_wall
total_office = 10 * per_office

# Calculate square feet of wall space in classrooms
classroom_short_wall = standard_wall_height * 25
classroom_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 40
per_classroom = 2 * classroom_short_wall + 2 * classroom_long_wall
total_classroom = 4 * per_classroom

# Calculate square feet of wall space in hallways
hallway_long_wall = standard_wall_height * 150
per_hallway = 2 * hallway_long_wall
total_hallway = 2 * per_hallway

# Calculate square feet of wall space in total
total = total_office + total_classroom + total_hallway
print(total)
```

```python
standard_wall_height = 10

def room_walls(width, length):
    wallA = standard_wall_height * width
    wallB = standard_wall_height * length
    return 2 * wallA + 2 * wallB

def rooms_total(count, width, length):
    return count * room_walls(width, length)

total_floor = rooms_total(10, 8, 12) + rooms_total(4, 25, 40) + rooms_total(2, 0, 150)
print(total_floor)
```

    15200



```python
#2)
wins = 0

# First game
colgate_score = 0
boston_college_score = 51
if (colgate_score > boston_college_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("Boston College won")

# Second game
colgate_score = 3
stony_brook_score = 24
if (colgate_score > stony_brook_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("Stony Brook won")
    
# Third game
colgate_score = 7
wm_score = 27
if (colgate_score > wm_score):
    print("Colgate won")
    wins = wins + 1
else:
    print("W&M won")
    
print("Colgate won", wins, "games")
```

    Boston College won
    Stony Brook won
    W&M won
    Colgate won 0 games



```python
def winner(colgate_score, oponent, oponent_score):
    if (colgate_score > oponent_score):
        print("Colgate won")
        win = True
    else:
        print(oponent, "won")
        win = False
    return win

wins = 0
if (winner(0, "Boston College", 51)):
    wins = wins + 1
if (winner(3, "Stony Brook", 24)):
    wins = wins + 1
if (winner(7, "W&M", 27)):
    wins = wins + 1 
print("Colgate won", wins, "games")
```

    Boston College won
    Stony Brook won
    W&M won
    Colgate won 0 games


## Extra practice

\#1) _Write a program that asks the user for three words and prints the word with the most vowels. Your program must include at least one function._


```python
def count_vowels(word):
    vowels = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter in "aeiou":
            vowels = vowels + 1
    return vowels

most = ""
for i in range(1,4):
    word = input("Word "+str(i)+": ")
    if (count_vowels(word) > count_vowels(most)):
        most = word
print(most, "has the most vowels")
```

    Word 1:  diversity
    Word 2:  equity
    Word 3:  inclusion


    inclusion has the most vowels


\#2) _Write a program that asks the user how many slices are desired for each of three different kinds of pizza and computes the number of pizzas of each kind to purchase. Assume one pizza has 8 slices. Your program must include at least one function._


```python
def slices_to_pizzas(slices):
    if (slices % 8 > 0):
        extra = 8 - (slices % 8)
        slices = slices + extra
    return slices // 8

for kind in ["cheese", "pepperoni", "veggie"]:
    slices = int(input("How many pieces of "+kind+" pizza? "))
    pizzas = slices_to_pizzas(slices)
    print("Order", pizzas, kind, "pizza(s)")
```

    How many pieces of cheese pizza?  15


    Order 2 cheese pizzas


    How many pieces of pepperoni pizza?  10


    Order 2 pepperoni pizzas


    How many pieces of veggie pizza?  8


    Order 1 veggie pizzas
